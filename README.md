# OSCPRepo

This is a list of resources and scripts that I have been gathering in preparation for the OSCP. These are all free resources on the Internet, so feel free to use however you want to help you in your studies/reference material. If I have taken information from you or your work, please let me know so that I can acknowledge you.
