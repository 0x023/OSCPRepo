# OSCPRepo

This is a list of resources and scripts that I have been gathering (and continuing to gather) in preparation for the OSCP. These are all free resources on the Internet, so feel free to use however you want to help you in your studies/reference material. If I have taken information from you or your work, please let me know so that I can acknowledge you. 

Big note. Nearly everything important is in the KeepNote notebook 'Usefulcommands'. It started as a reference using KeepNote since it was easy, relatively hassle free, and part of the default install on Kali. The Windows version is great as well.
