# OSCPRepo

This is a list of resources and scripts that I have been gathering (and continuing to gather) in preparation for the OSCP. These are all free resources on the Internet, so feel free to use however you want to help you in your studies/reference material. If I have taken information from you or your work, please let me know so that I can acknowledge you.

# Two Primary Functions
UsefulCommands.nbk

Nearly everything important is in the KeepNote notebook 'Usefulcommands'. It started as a reference using KeepNote since it was easy, relatively hassle free, and part of the default install on Kali. The Windows version is great as well. It contains methodologies, links to scripts, tools, links to popular resources, reference guides on numerous subjects, and more. 

Recon_Scan.py

A popular script, it's goal is to run nmap, identify popular services, and then pass that discovery on to other scripts for detailed enumeration etc. I have just updated its default functionality to be OneTwoPunch, ie a unicornscan that passes its findings to nmap. This functionality could probably be imported into Sparta (a cool gui tool). It's also probably worse than Vanquish. For now, it get's the job done with a single ./reconscan.py. 

# Other Stuff

Folders mostly speak for themselves. Lists contains a bunch of wordlists. Some methodologies and cheat sheets are downloaded. Some tools and scripts are kept local until they become integrated. ListOfSoftwareToAptGet.txt contains some information on setup that a user might want to consider when this repo is cloned from a default Kali installation.
