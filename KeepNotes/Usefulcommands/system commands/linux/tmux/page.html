<title>tmux</title>
</head><body>Here is a list of a few basic tmux commands:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ctrl+b " — split pane horizontally.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ctrl+b % — split pane vertically.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ctrl+b arrow key — switch pane.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hold Ctrl+b, don’t release it and hold one of the arrow keys — resize pane.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ctrl+b c — (c)reate a new window.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ctrl+b n — move to the (n)ext window.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Ctrl+b p — move to the (p)revious window.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>$ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rename the current session</b>.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>( &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Switch the attached client to the previous session.</b><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Switch the attached client to the next session.</b><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rename the current window.</b><br/>
<br/>
Other thing worth knowing is that scrolling is enabled by pressing Ctrl+b PgUp/PgDown. In fact, it enables the copy mode, which can also be done by pressing Ctrl+b [. When in copy mode, you can use PgUp/PgDown and arrow keys to scroll through the terminal contents. To (q)uit the copy mode, simply press the q key.<br/>
<br/>
That should do the trick. At least, most of it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
KEY BINDINGS<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tmux may be controlled from an attached client by using a key combination of a prefix key, ‘C-b’ (Ctrl-b) by<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;default, followed by a command key.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The default command key bindings are:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C-b &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Send the prefix key (C-b) through to the application.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C-o &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rotate the panes in the current window forwards.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C-z &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suspend the tmux client.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Break the current pane out of the window.</b><br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Split the current pane into two, top and bottom.</b><br/>
