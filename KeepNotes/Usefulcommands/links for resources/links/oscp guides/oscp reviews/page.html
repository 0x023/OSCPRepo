Advice:<br/>
I also made sure to have a nice page of “quick scripts” that I could copy and paste into a terminal, such as a <b>wget powershell script</b>, <b>ftp download script</b>, etc… These were all from techniques I used in the labs.<br/>
Windows was also not my strongest privesc platform (as shown by the labs), so I made sure to have a list of quick-win checks for privilege escalation on a windows box.<br/>
Lesson learned: Have a process, know your process, stick to your process.<br/>
Check firewall/IPTable rules (or remove them)<br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Experimenting with different vulnerable machines on VulnHub such as Tr0ll, Kioptrix and bWAPP.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Also check out Bandit at OverTheWire to get started.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I cant stress enough the importance of taking notes and screenshots as you go. This has been reiterated to death on many OSCP reviews and should be practiced religiously. <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I didn’t manage my time and rotate between machines - spending 12 hours on 3 machines was pretty stupid in retrospect. I cant even recall why I needed to spend as much time as I did on those 3 boxes. Possibly because I was over-complicating things when I should have been looking at what was staring me directly in the face. I should have utilized my time more efficiently.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had no structure or plan of attack going into the exam - Out of all of the things I have listed, this by far was the biggest point of failure. I tried to wing it through the exam and was punished. My methodological approach needed to approve.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I then created my own methodologies that consisted of a holistic penetration testing approach leveraging manual testing techniques in the following areas:<ul><li>Host Discovery</li>
<li>Enumeration and Service Discovery</li>
<li>Vulnerability Assessment and Analysis</li>
<li>Web Application Penetration Testing</li>
<li>Infrastructure Penetration and Privilege Escalation</li>
<li>Post Exploitation</li>
</ul>
