Advice:<br/>
I also made sure to have a nice page of “quick scripts” that I could copy and paste into a terminal, such as a wget powershell script, ftp download script, etc… These were all from techniques I used in the labs.<br/>
Windows was also not my strongest privesc platform (as shown by the labs), so I made sure to have a list of quick-win checks for privilege escalation on a windows box.<br/>
Lesson learned: Have a process, know your process, stick to your process.<br/>
Check firewall/IPTable rules (or remove them)<br/>
