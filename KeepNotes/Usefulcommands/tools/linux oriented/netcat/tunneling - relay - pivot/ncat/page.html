<title>Ncat</title>
</head><body>The Nmap project released a reimplementation of Netcat (Nmap Project) called Ncat. They added additional functionality. If the Rules of Engagement allows for the installation of software or it is already present, then Ncat is a candidate pivoting tool.<br/>
<br/>
One new feature is --keep-open, which allows multiple connections simultaneously and does not terminate at the end of a connection. This, however, does not solve the problem of losing connections when setting up an ncat relay as this option is only available for the Ncat listener, not the Ncat client. Thus it suffers from the problems of trying to use a Netcat relay as discussed earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Another new feature is the ability to setup Ncat as an HTTP proxy. The Ncat HTTP proxy can be setup on the pivot server using:<br/>
ncat --listen --proxy-type http 192.168.112.133 8080</body></html>
