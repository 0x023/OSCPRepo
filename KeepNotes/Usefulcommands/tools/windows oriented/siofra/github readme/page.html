<br/>
Siofra is a tool designed to identify and exploit DLL hijacking vulnerabilities <br/>
in Windows programs. It is able to simulate the Windows loader in order to give <br/>
visibility into all of the dependencies (and corresponding vulnerabilities) of <br/>
a PE on disk, or alternatively an image file in memory corresponding to an active <br/>
process. More significantly, the tool has the ability to easily generate DLLs to <br/>
exploit these types of vulnerabilities via PE infection with dynamic shellcode creation. <br/>
These infected DLLs retain the code (DllMain, exported functions) as well as the <br/>
resources of a DLL to seamlessly preserve the functionality of the application loading <br/>
them, while at the same time allowing the researcher to specify an executable payload <br/>
to be either run as a separate process or loaded into the target as a module. Additionally, <br/>
the tool contains automated methods of combining UAC auto-elevation criteria with <br/>
the aforementioned functionality in order to scan for UAC bypass vulnerabilities.<br/>
<br/>
# Vulnerabilities<br/>
<br/>
At present, there is a very large number of vulnerabilities which this tool exposes. <br/>
While testing this tool I encountered only several applications which were not vulnerable <br/>
out of hundreds which I tested against. Note that these vulnerabilities can be exploited <br/>
despite SafeDllSearchMode. A common misconception results from confusing the "current <br/>
directory" (fixed with SafeDllSearchMode) with the "application directory" (the <br/>
folder containing the .exe itself). The vast majority of DLL hijacking vulnerabilities <br/>
currently present in Windows programs stem from the application directory (which <br/>
comes first in the Windows search order). Several highlights are listed below in <br/>
the output produced by the scanner in the tool. The last time these vulnerabilities <br/>
were tested was in mid-July 2017.<br/>

# Capabilities<br/>
<br/>
The capabilities of this tool can be split into 3 separate categories, each corresponding <br/>
to one of the execution modes of this tool.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; ## Infection mode<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; When in infection mode, the tool is capable of generating infected copies of both <br/>
&nbsp; 32 and 64-bit DLL files. These infected files are able to hijack the execution flow <br/>
&nbsp; of a target application when they are loaded during process initialization, causing <br/>
&nbsp; either a payload DLL to be loaded or a payload executable to be launched prior to <br/>
&nbsp; the execution of the target application entry point.<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; ## File scanning mode<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; When in file scanning mode, the tool may be given either an executable file path <br/>
&nbsp; or a folder (which will be searched for executable files, optionally with recursion) <br/>
&nbsp; which will recursively have its PE imports, delay load imports, API sets, assembly <br/>
&nbsp; dependencies, and explicitly loaded libraries enumerated and processed to determine <br/>
&nbsp; the path at which each will be loaded during runtime process initialization. With <br/>
&nbsp; this information, the tool is able to identify modules which are vulnerable to hijacking. <br/>
&nbsp; During PE processing and loader simulation, the tool is capable of handling:<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Modules imported using the primary PE imports section.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Modules imported via delay load.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. WinSxS assembly dependency resolution (the PE manifest resource is parsed, assembly <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dependency IDs are extracted, and the WinSxS module path is identified using<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a custom implementation).<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Explicitly loaded modules, imported via LoadLibrary at runtime.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. API set resolution of all of the above import types. This is achieved via a <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;custom implementation of a parser for the undocumented data structures found in <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ApiSetSchema.dll (note that only versions 2, 4 and 6 have been tested).<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 6. Searching for specific imported modules by name.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 7. Identifying Windows components which can be leveraged for UAC bypass attacks <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(the UAC auto-elevation criteria are applied to a specified target PE in an<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;automated way, then used in conjunction with a hijacking attack if one is present).<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 8. Automatically detect and filter module dependencies which are not<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;vulnerable on the basis of:<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* KnownDLLs<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* Exempt ("Base") DLL status. Kernelbase.dll, ntdll.dll, etc.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* Manifest override security mechanism (used by Microsoft in sysprep.exe)<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; ## Memory scanning mode<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; When in memory scanning mode, the tool can either enumerate local process names/IDs <br/>
&nbsp; or it can be given a process ID to scan. Rather than parsing the image file corresponding <br/>
&nbsp; to the given PID on disk, the tool will enumerate the modules currently loaded into <br/>
&nbsp; the process and identify which of them may be vulnerable to hijacking. This is useful <br/>
&nbsp; in instances where an executable on disk is packed/obfuscated and its imports cannot <br/>
&nbsp; be identified through parsing the PE header.<br/>
<br/>
# Usage<br/>
<br/>
In order to display the tool usage information, simply run it with no parameters <br/>
(output shown below). It is very important to use the appropriate compilation of <br/>
the tool (32 or 64-bit) for the desired target depending upon whether it is a 32-bit PE <br/>
or 64-bit PE file. Similarly, the 32-bit version of the tool can only enumerate and/or <br/>
target 32-bit processes (Wow64 on an x64 OS) and the 64-bit version can only enumerate <br/>
and/or target 64-bit processes. This principle applies both to scanning (Siofra64.exe <br/>
will skip 32-bit PE and Siofra32.exe will skip 64-bit PE) and to PE infection. Siofra32.exe <br/>
should be used to infect 32-bit DLLs and Siofra64.exe should be used to infect 64-bit <br/>
DLLs.<br/>
<br/>
When the 32-bit version of the tool is run on x64 systems Wow64 path redirection <br/>
is explicitly disabled by the tool, which means that if you were to target \Windows\System32\notepad.exe <br/>
it would be a 64-bit PE (and therefore \Windows\Syswow64\notepad.exe should be used instead). <br/>
Similarly if you were to target \Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\MSInfo\msinfo32.exe <br/>
it would be a 64-bit PE, and therefore \Program Files (x86)\Common Files\microsoft shared\MSInfo\msinfo32.exe <br/>
should be used instead.<br/>

<br/>
&nbsp; ## Examples<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; 1. Scanning the entire home drive for 32-bit programs vulnerable to DLL hijacking <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;using either standard or delay load imports through their PE headers.<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Siofra32.exe --mode file-scan -f "C:/" -r --enum-dependency --dll-hijack --delayload<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; 2. Scanning the Windows Defender application folder on an x64 version of Windows <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for vulnerable modules loaded through the standard import table in their PE header.<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Siofra64.exe --mode file-scan -f "C:\Program Files\Windows Defender" -r --enum-dependency <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--dll-hijack<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; 3. Scanning the 32-bit Java Update Scheduler program on an x64 version of Windows <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for vulnerable modules loaded through any known channel (standard or delayload imports, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WinSxS, LoadLibrary).<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Siofra32.exe --mode file-scan -f "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Java\Java <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Update\jusched.exe" --enum-dependency --dll-hijack --delayload --explicit-loadlibrary<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; 4. Scanning the Windows folder (and all its subfolders) for vulnerable modules <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(imported via the standard imports table in the PE header) in 64-bit programs which <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;could be used for a UAC bypass attack (signed by Microsoft with an auto-elevate <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;manifest).<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Siofra64.exe --mode file-scan -f "C:\Windows" -r --enum-dependency --dll-hijack <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--auto-elevate --signed<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; 5. Infecting a 32-bit copy of WININET.dll (copied from \Windows\SysWOW64\WININET.dll <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to .\WININET_original.dll) with an implant which will launch a new notepad process <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;when loaded during process initialization by a vulnerable program. It's important <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to note that simply loading an infected copy of this DLL (via LoadLibrary for example) <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;will not trigger the payload. Infected DLLs are only meant to work in the context <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;of a vulnerable module loaded via the standard imports section of its host process.<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Siofra32.exe --mode infect -f WININET_original.dll -o WININET.dll --payload-type <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;process --payload-path c:\windows\system32\notepad.exe<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; 6. Infecting a 64-bit copy of USERENV.dll (copied from \Windows\System32\USERENV.dll <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to .\USERENV_original.dll) with an implant which will load a hypothetical payload <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DLL stored at C:\Payload.dll. It's important to note that all DLLs loaded by a 64-bit <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;process must be 64-bit DLLs, and all DLLs loaded by a 32-bit process must be 32-bit <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DLLs. Therefore in this hypothetical scenario, Payload.dll would need to be a 64-bit PE <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;file for it to be loaded successfully by the implant in USERENV.dll.<br/>
&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Siofra64.exe --mode infect -f USERENV_original.dll -o USERENV.dll --payload-type <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;library --payload-path "C:\Payload.dll"<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
# Future improvements<br/>
<br/>
* 32 and 64-bit versions of the tool to be combined into a single executable.<br/>
* Capability to perform PE infections which can successfully load DLL/executable <br/>
&nbsp; payloads within infected DLL files loaded explicitly via LoadLibrary or through <br/>
&nbsp; delayed imports.<br/>
* Support for all API set versions.<br/>

# Source code<br/>
<br/>
I've decided to make some of this tool open source to help other security <br/>
researchers understand the technical details of this project. Specifically I've <br/>
provided assembler source code for one of the 64-bit implant shellcodes (for 64-bit PE <br/>
DLL infection when specifying a "process" payload type).<br/>
<br/>
Details surrounding other technical aspects of the tool and OS details related<br/>
to the Windows loader/search order, UAC, WinSxS etc. can be found within the<br/>
PDF for this project.<br/>
