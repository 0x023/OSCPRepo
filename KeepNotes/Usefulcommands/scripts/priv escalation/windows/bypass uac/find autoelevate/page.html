<title>Find autoElevate</title>
</head><body>Earlier, we went over the different UAC settings. The default UAC setting will not prompt the user when some built-in Windows programs try to elevate themselves. More practically, this means that some built-in Windows programs always run in a high integrity context.<br/>
<br/>
These programs that automatically elevate have a few properties. They are signed with Microsoft’s code signing certificate. They are located in a “secure” folder (e.g., c:\windows\system32). And, they request the right to autoElevate in their manifest.<br/>
<br/>
We can find which programs autoElevate themselves with a little strings magic:<br/>
<br/>
cd c:\windows\<br/>
strings –s *.exe | findstr /i autoelevate</body></html>
