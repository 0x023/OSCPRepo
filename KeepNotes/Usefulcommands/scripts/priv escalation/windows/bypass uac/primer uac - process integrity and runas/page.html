<title>UAC / Process integrity and RunAs</title>
</head><body>User account control<br/>
<br/>
In Windows Vista and later, processes run at three different levels of integrity: high, medium, and low. A high integrity process has administrator rights. A medium integrity process is one that runs with standard user rights. A low integrity process is very restricted. Most desktop applications run in a medium integrity process, even if the current user is a local administrator. Use Process Explorer to see which Integrity level your programs are running at.<br/>
<br/>
Mandatory Label\High Mandatory Level. This means I have administrator rights.<br/>
Mandatory Label\Medium Mandatory Level. This means I have standard user rights.<br/>
<br/>
RunAs<br/>
Simply runAs Administrator and ask the user to accept. Most executables can use ShellExecute and pass the 'runas' verb<br/>
<br/>
The Metasploit Framework’s exploit/windows/local/ask module by mubix implements this attack for you. Make sure you set EXE::Custom to avoid anti-virus!<br/>
<br/>
Bypass UAC (Windows 7)<br/>
The RunAs option prompts the user and that’s an opportunity to get caught. We want a way to spawn a high integrity process from a medium integrity process without a prompt. Fortunately, there is a way to do this, it’s the bypass UAC attack.<br/>
They also released the exploit/windows/local/bypassuac MSF module that uses Leo’s proof-of-concept for the heavy lifting.<br/>
<br/>
The bypass UAC attack <b>requires that UAC is set to the default</b>&nbsp;Notify me only when programs try to make changes to my computer. If UAC is set to Always Notify, this attack will not work. This attack also <b>requires that our current user is in an administrators group.</b><br/>
<br/>
We get code execution through DLL search order hijacking. The public versions of the bypass UAC attack copy a CRYPTBASE.dll file to c:\windows\system32\sysprep and run c:\windows\system32\sysprep.exe. When sysprep.exe runs it will search for CRYPTBASE.dll and find the malicious one first.<br/>
<br/>
Because sysprep.exe automatically runs in a high integrity context (when UAC is set to default), the code in the attacker controlled CRYPTBASE.dll will execute in this high integrity context too. From there, we’re free to do whatever we like. We have our administrator privileges.<br/>
<br/>
A recent addition to the Metasploit Framework is the <b>exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_inject</b>&nbsp;module. &nbsp;This module compiles the UAC bypass logic into a reflective DLL. It spawns a Microsoft-signed program and injects the UAC bypass logic directly into it. The only thing that needs to touch disk is the CRYPTBASE.dll file.<br/>
<br/>
Bypass UAC (Windows 8.1)<br/>
I audited all of the autoElevate programs on a stock Windows 8.1 to find another DLL hijacking opportunity. I had to find a program that would load my DLL before displaying anything to the user. There were quite a few false starts. In the end, I found my candidate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lateral Movement and UAC<br/>
The concept of process integrity level only applies to the current system. When you interact with a network resource, your access token is all that matters. If your current user is a domain user and your domain user is a local administrator on another system, you can get past UAC. Here’s how this works:<br/>
<br/>
You may use your token to interact with another system as an administrator. This means you may copy an executable to that other system and schedule it to run. If you get access to another system this way, you may repeat the same process to regain access to your current system with full rights.<br/>
<br/>
You may use the Metasploit Framework’s exploit/windows/local/current_user_psexec to do this.<br/>
