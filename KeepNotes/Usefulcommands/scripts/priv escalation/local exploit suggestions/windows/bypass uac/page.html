<title>Bypass UAC</title>

Bypassing UAC<br/>
Exploiting UAC is a trivial process. There are <b>two stages needed</b>&nbsp;to be taken to achieve bypass to elevate from standard user rights to administrator user rights. <br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Writing to a secure location (use iFileOperation COM Object or Windows Update Standalone Installer (wusa.exe))<br/>
&nbsp;Exploiting DLL hijacking vulnerability<br/>
<br/>
In order for our bypass to be successful to start off with we need<ul><li style="list-style-type: none"></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;A medium integrity process<br/>
&nbsp;A standard user in an administrators group (required for COM / wusa)<br/>
&nbsp;Windows executable must be signed by Microsoft code signing certificate<br/>
&nbsp;Windows executable must be located in a secure directory<br/>
&nbsp;Windows executable also must specify the auto Elevate property in their manifest<br/>
<br/>
Writing to a secure location<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Using the IFileOperation COM Object<br/>
&nbsp;Using Windows Update Standalone Installer (wusa.exe)<br/>
<br/>
FileOperation COM Object<br/>
The IFileOperation COM object has a method that we can use to copy files to our secure location as the operation will auto-elevate and able to do a privilege copy. To exploit we can in inject our malicious DLL in a medium integrity process to carry out the operation. Since the COM object is set to auto-elevate the injected process does not need to be marked for auto-elevation in its manifest.<br/>
<br/>
On windows 7 injected processes that have copied successfully are<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;C:\Windows\explorer.exe <br/>
&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32\wuauclt.exe<br/>
&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32\taskhost.exe<br/>
During tests taskhost.exe only happens to work once after boot and wuauclt.exe doesnâ€™t always work which leaves explorer.exe is only the reliable process to use.<br/>
<br/>
On Windows 8 injected processes that have copied successfully are<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;C:\Windows\explorer.exe<br/>
&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32\wuauclt.exe<br/>
&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32\RuntimeBroker.exe<br/>
Again explorer.exe is only the reliable process to use I found during my tests and the only one that worked on Windows 8.1<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Windows Update Standalone Installer<br/>
Another method to use to copy to our secure location is using Windows Update Standalone Installer (wusa.exe). Wusa.exe when executed runs as a high integrity process as its set to auto-elevate in its manifest. For auto-elevation the Windows executable must be signed, located in a secure directory such as C:\Windows\System32 and must specify the autoElevate property in their manifest.<br/>
<br/>
We use wusa.exe to extract a CAB file (cabinet archive file) to our secure location<br/>
<br/>
wusa c:\users\user1\desktop\poc.tmp /extract:c:\windows\system32\sysprep<br/>
<br/>
Here in the example our cab file is called poc.tmp but we can call it whatever we like. Windows comes with the makecab.exe tool so we can even create our cab file<br/>
<br/>
makecab c:\users\user1\desktop\CRYPTBASE.dll c:\users\user1\desktop\poc.tmp</body></html>
