<title>Mitigations to check for</title>
</head><body>Mitigation<br/>
The best way to mitigate this bypass is just by not giving users local admin rights to their machines. Majority of user accounts in a corporate environment you should be able to do this reducing the attack surface. This however does not apply home users which would have local admin rights by default.<br/>
<br/>
The actual bypass only works when set to the middle two UAC settings which will let it auto-elevate. <br/>
Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer (default)<br/>
Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer (do not dim desktop settings)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To see your settings you need to go to Control Panel – User Accounts – Change User Account Control settings.<br/>
so we could set to Always notify but this would bring it back to like it was on Windows Vista with constant notifications and not really practical and the user would end up setting it to Never notify which is definitely not a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft has given us 10 UAC policies to play with so it’s worth spending some time understanding and testing these out before implementing it in your own domain environment. To see what is applied on your local machine type secpol.msc into Start-Run to open the Local Security Policy snap-in and expand the Local Policies-Security Options folder. Run rsop.msc to view group policies applied on machines in a domain environment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Looking in the registry these are the default values of UAC<br/>
<br/>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System]<br/>
"ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin"=dword:00000005<br/>
"ConsentPromptBehaviorUser"=dword:00000003<br/>
"EnableInstallerDetection"=dword:00000001<br/>
"EnableLUA"=dword:00000001<br/>
"EnableSecureUIAPaths"=dword:00000001<br/>
"EnableUIADesktopToggle"=dword:00000000<br/>
"EnableVirtualization"=dword:00000001<br/>
"FilterAdministratorToken"=dword:00000000<br/>
"PromptOnSecureDesktop"=dword:00000001<br/>
"ValidateAdminCodeSignatures"=dword:00000000<br/>
<br/>
When the slider is moved upto “Always notify me” it changes this value<br/>
<br/>
"ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin"=dword:00000002<br/>
<br/>
When the slider is moved down to “Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer (do not dim desktop settings)” it changes this value<br/>
<br/>
"PromptOnSecureDesktop"=dword:00000000<br/>
<br/>
And when the slider is moved to “Never notify” the values changed are<br/>
<br/>
"ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin"=dword:00000000<br/>
"EnableLUA"=dword:00000000<br/>
"PromptOnSecureDesktop"=dword:00000000<br/>
<br/>
Take note that EnableLUA has been disabled completely. This is an extremely dangerous value to be in and should never be disabled so its strongly recommend to set this settings to be enabled in group policies so it always gets applied if settings are reset/changed by users or by previously removed malware.<br/>
<br/>
User Account Control: Run all administrators in Admin Approval Mode<br/>
<br/>
Once disabled not only a malicious process could be able to go straight to high integrity without any bypass but also Internet Explorer would run in medium integrity. UAC gives us the Protected Mode (sandbox) in Internet Explorer providing added security. Internet Explorer normally runs in low integrity child process so if compromised by some IE exploit the damage is minimized as in low integrity there are only a handful of locations it can be written to on the system.<br/>
<br/>
These changes mentioned above have been seen on Windows 7. On Windows 8/8.1 EnableLUA does not change to disabled. So when the slider is moved to Never notify the values changed are only<br/>
<br/>
"ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin"=dword:00000000<br/>
"PromptOnSecureDesktop"=dword:00000000<br/>
Since value “EnableLUA”=dword:00000001 does not change, UAC is not completely disabled and Internet Explorer would still run in low integrity.<br/>
<br/>
If however a user logged onto a machine using the local admin account (administrator or whatever renamed on your corporate build) UAC settings does not apply as all processes run in high integrity. This applies to Windows 7/8 and 8.1 so always make sure users DO NOT logon using local admin account, if local admin rights are required better add their domain account to the local administrators group.<br/>
<br/>
If for whatever reason logging on using the local admin account is a necessity then best set this UAC policy to enabled.<br/>
<br/>
User Account Control: Admin Approval Mode for the built-in Administrator account<br/>
“FilterAdministratorToken”=dword:00000001<br/>
<br/>
Another option would be to look into renaming or deleting the executables Mcx2Prov.exe, sysprep.exe, cliconfg.exe and pwcreator.exe if definitely not required on the system so the second stage to exploit DLL hijacking fails.<br/>
<br/>
Finally if users do require local admin privileges then worth setting their machine UAC policy to Always notify and they live with the constant notifications.<br/>
<br/>
User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for administrators in Admin Approval Mode (2-Prompt for consent on the secure desktop)<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion<br/>
This bypass only works when all of the requirements are available to abuse. Remove one requirement and the bypass will fail. Office documents are opened in medium integrity so these are ideal targets to abuse the UAC bypass. Since these bypasses are so effortlessly achieved the only real course of action would be to set UAC to “Always notify” or remove local admin rights for the user. In the end using agents like Microsoft EMET or MalwareBytes Anti-Exploit would be the best mitigating action to take from initially being exploited in the first place.<br/>

Here are the source and binaries you can test for yourself. I tested it on Windows Enterprise 7/8/8.1 64bit<br/>
