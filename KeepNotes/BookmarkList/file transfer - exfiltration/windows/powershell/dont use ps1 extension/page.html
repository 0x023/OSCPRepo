<title>Dont Use ps1 Extension</title>
</head><body>While you may have blocked execution of an extension such as .ps1, an attacker can bypass it by using anther extension. For example, PowerShell’s Get-Content can access the content of a .ps2 malware script and pass it to Invoke-Expression (iex) for execution:<br/>
<br/>
powershell.exe –ep Bypass “&amp; {Get-Content .\malware.ps2 | iex}<br/>
<br/>
This is a security issue since the iex cmdlet opens up the script to injection attacks.</body></html>
