<title>Intercept Server Responses</title>
</head><body>In Burp you can intercept server responses as well<br/>
Say you went to a page and it wanted to redirect you (301/2) to another page (specified in the Location: header). You can intercept the redirect response from the server, replace with a 200 OK and may receive unintended information<br/>
<br/>
Can also add a "match and replace" in Burp. Say match any 302 (found) or 301 (redirect) responses with 200 ok? or maybe try to have it redirect you to various places in the application that you know about<br/>
