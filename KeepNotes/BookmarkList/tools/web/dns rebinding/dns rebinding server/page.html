<title>DNS Rebinding Server</title>
</head><body>https://github.com/allanlw/dns-rebinding-server<br/>
An integrated DNS/HTTP server for performing DNS rebinding written in Go. Powers rebindmy.zone<br/>
<br/>
Project to implement a DNS server and client program to facilitate DNS rebinding attacks. Contact: dcooper@akamai.com, awirth@akamai.com<br/>
<br/>
To build:<br/>
<br/>
docker build -t dnsrebind .<br/>
To run (with http server on localhost:8080 in the host):<br/>
<br/>
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/conf:/etc/dnsrebind/ -p80:80 -p53:8053/udp -p53:8053/tcp -p10000:10000 dnsrebind<br/>
This will use the configuration file in $(pwd)/conf/dnsrebind.yml.<br/>
<br/>
There's a format script. you need sudo npm install -g js-beautify standard to have the right tools.<br/>
<br/>
IPTables Voodoo<br/>
We want a secondary IP address to slurp all traffic on all ports. We need to add a secondary IP to the server. Follow this Stack Exchange answer: https://serverfault.com/a/864615<br/>
<br/>
Then, we need to write an iptables rule to redirect the traffic:<br/>
<br/>
sudo iptables -I PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -d 172.31.36.162 -p tcp --dport 1:65535 -j DNAT --to-destination 172.31.39.125:10000<br/>
Note, replace the first and second IP addresses with the appropriate internal IPs.<br/>
<br/>
To inspect the rule, use:<br/>
<br/>
sudo iptables -L -t nat<br/>
