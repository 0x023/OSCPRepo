<title>LM and NTLM Example</title>
</head><body>Hashcat cracking LM, brute both sides of the hash. start with 7 and decrement until you have both sides<br/>
?u?u?u?u?u?u?u<br/>
?u?u?u?u?u?u<br/>
?u?u?u?u?u<br/>
etc<br/>
<br/>
?u is hashcat for bruteforcing a capital letter (which LM is all caps)<br/>
<br/>
Take cracked LM hash in both upper and lower, put them in a dictionary, now crack the NTLM:<br/>
hashcat -m 1000 ntlm.hash lm.dict -r rules/toggles5.rule <br/>
<br/>
the rule will toggle casing. since LM is all upper, it is usually NOT the actual password, but NTLM will have actual password with casing </body></html>
