</head><body>The Service File Name contains a command string to execute (%COMSPEC% points to the absolute path of cmd.exe). It echos the command to be executed to a bat file, redirects the stdout and stderr to a Temp file, then executes the bat file and deletes it. Back on Kali, the Python script then pulls the output file via SMB and displays the contents in our "pseudo-shell". For every command we type into our "shell", a new service is created and the process is repeated. This is why it doesn't need to drop a binary, it just executes each desired command as a new service. Definitely more stealthy, but as we saw, an event log is created for every command executed. Still a very clever way to get a non-interactive "shell"!</body></html>
