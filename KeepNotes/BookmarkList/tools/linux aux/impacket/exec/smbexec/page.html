<title>Smbexec</title>
</head><body>The Service File Name contains a command string to execute (%COMSPEC% points to the absolute path of cmd.exe). It echos the command to be executed to a bat file, redirects the stdout and stderr to a Temp file, then executes the bat file and deletes it. Back on Kali, the Python script then pulls the output file via SMB and displays the contents in our "pseudo-shell". For every command we type into our "shell", a new service is created and the process is repeated. This is why it doesn't need to drop a binary, it just executes each desired command as a new service. Definitely more stealthy, but as we saw, an event log is created for every command executed. Still a very clever way to get a non-interactive "shell"!<br/>
<br/>
smbexec.py<br/>
<br/>
A similar approach to psexec w/o using RemComSvc. The technique is described here http://blog.accuvant.com/rdavisaccuvant/owning-computers-without-shell-access/.<br/>
Our implementation goes one step further, instantiating a local smbserver to receive the output of the commands. This is useful in the situation where the target machine does NOT have a writeable share available.<br/>
<br/>
# This script works in two ways:<br/>
# 1) share mode: you specify a share, and everything is done through that share.<br/>
# 2) server mode: if for any reason there's no share available, this script will launch a local<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp;SMB server, so the output of the commands executed are sent back by the target machine<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp;into a locally shared folder. Keep in mind you would need root access to bind to port 445 <br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp;in the local machine.<br/>

usage: smbexec.py [-h] [-share SHARE] [-mode {SHARE,SERVER}] [-debug]<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [-dc-ip ip address] [-target-ip ip address]<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [-port [destination port]] [-hashes LMHASH:NTHASH]<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [-no-pass] [-k] [-aesKey hex key]<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; target<br/>
<br/>
positional arguments:<br/>
&nbsp; target &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[[domain/]username[:password]@]&lt;targetName or address&gt;<br/>
<br/>
optional arguments:<br/>
&nbsp; -h, --help &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;show this help message and exit<br/>
&nbsp; -share SHARE &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;share where the output will be grabbed from (default<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C$)<br/>
&nbsp; -mode {SHARE,SERVER} &nbsp;mode to use (default SHARE, SERVER needs root!)<br/>
&nbsp; -debug &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Turn DEBUG output ON<br/>
<br/>
connection:<br/>
&nbsp; -dc-ip ip address &nbsp; &nbsp; IP Address of the domain controller. If omitted it<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will use the domain part (FQDN) specified in the<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; target parameter<br/>
&nbsp; -target-ip ip address<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IP Address of the target machine. If ommited it will<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; use whatever was specified as target. This is useful<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when target is the NetBIOS name and you cannot resolve<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it<br/>
&nbsp; -port [destination port]<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Destination port to connect to SMB Server<br/>
<br/>
authentication:<br/>
&nbsp; -hashes LMHASH:NTHASH<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NTLM hashes, format is LMHASH:NTHASH<br/>
&nbsp; -no-pass &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;don't ask for password (useful for -k)<br/>
&nbsp; -k &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Use Kerberos authentication. Grabs credentials from<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ccache file (KRB5CCNAME) based on target parameters.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If valid credentials cannot be found, it will use the<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ones specified in the command line<br/>
&nbsp; -aesKey hex key &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AES key to use for Kerberos Authentication (128 or 256<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bits)<br/>
