# Description: Performs various techniques to dump hashes from the<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;remote machine without executing any agent there.<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For SAM and LSA Secrets (including cached creds)<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;we try to read as much as we can from the registry<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and then we save the hives in the target system<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(%SYSTEMROOT%\\Temp dir) and read the rest of the<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;data from there.<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For NTDS.dit we either:<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a. Get the domain users list and get its hashes<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and Kerberos keys using [MS-DRDS] DRSGetNCChanges()<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; call, replicating just the attributes we need.<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;b. Extract NTDS.dit via vssadmin executed &nbsp;with the<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; smbexec approach.<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's copied on the temp dir and parsed remotely.<br/>
#<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The script initiates the services required for its working<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if they are not available (e.g. Remote Registry, even if it is <br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;disabled). After the work is done, things are restored to the <br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;original state.<br/>
