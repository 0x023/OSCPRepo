<title>NTLMrelayX</title>
</head><body># Description:<br/>
# &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This module performs the SMB Relay attacks originally discovered<br/>
# by cDc extended to many target protocols (SMB, MSSQL, LDAP, etc).<br/>
# It receives a list of targets and for every connection received it<br/>
# will choose the next target and try to relay the credentials. Also, if<br/>
# specified, it will first to try authenticate against the client connecting<br/>
# to us.<br/>
#<br/>
# It is implemented by invoking a SMB and HTTP Server, hooking to a few<br/>
# functions and then using the specific protocol clients (e.g. SMB, LDAP).<br/>
# It is supposed to be working on any LM Compatibility level. The only way<br/>
# to stop this attack is to enforce on the server SPN checks and or signing.<br/>
#<br/>
# If the authentication against the targets succeeds, the client authentication<br/>
# succeeds as well and a valid connection is set against the local smbserver.<br/>
# It's up to the user to set up the local smbserver functionality. One option<br/>
# is to set up shares with whatever files you want to so the victim thinks it's<br/>
# connected to a valid SMB server. All that is done through the smb.conf file or<br/>
# programmatically.<br/>

For every connection received, this module will try to relay that connection<br/>
to specified target(s) system or the original client<br/>
<br/>
Main options:<br/>
&nbsp; -h, --help &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;show this help message and exit<br/>
&nbsp; -debug &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Turn DEBUG output ON<br/>
&nbsp; -t TARGET, --target TARGET<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Target to relay the credentials to, can be an IP,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hostname or URL like smb://server:445 If unspecified,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; it will relay back to the client<br/>
&nbsp; -tf TARGETSFILE &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; File that contains targets by hostname or full URL,<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one per line<br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; executing a command after a successful relay. This<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; console will listen locally on a tcp port and can be<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; reached with for example netcat.<br/>
&nbsp; -ip INTERFACE_IP, --interface-ip INTERFACE_IP<br/>

&nbsp; -of OUTPUT_FILE, --output-file OUTPUT_FILE<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; base output filename for encrypted hashes. Suffixes<br/>

&nbsp; -codec CODEC &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sets encoding used (codec) from the target's output<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (default "ascii"). If errors are detected, run<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; chcp.com at the target, map the result with<br/>
