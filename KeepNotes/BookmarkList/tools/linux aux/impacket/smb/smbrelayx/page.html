<br/>
This module performs the SMB Relay attacks originally discovered by cDc. It receives a list of targets and for every connection received it will choose the next target and try to relay the credentials. Also, if specified, it will first to try authenticate against the client connecting to us.<br/>
It is implemented by invoking a SMB and HTTP Server, hooking to a few functions and then using the smbclient portion. It is supposed to be working on any LM Compatibility level. The only way to stop this attack is to enforce on the server SPN checks and or signing. If the authentication against the targets succeed, the client authentication success as well and a valid connection is set against the local smbserver. It's up to the user to set up the local smbserver functionality. One option is to set up shares with whatever files you want to the victim thinks it's connected to a valid SMB server. All that is done through the smb.conf file or programmatically.<br/>
