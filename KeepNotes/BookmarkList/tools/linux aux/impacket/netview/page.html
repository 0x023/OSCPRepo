Gets a list of the sessions opened at the remote hosts and keep track of them looping over the hosts found and keeping track of who logged in/out from remote servers<br/>
<br/>
# Description:<br/>
# &nbsp; The idea of this script is to get a list of the sessions<br/>
# &nbsp; opened at the remote hosts and keep track of them.<br/>
# &nbsp; Coincidentally @mubix did something similar a few years<br/>
# &nbsp; ago so credit goes to him (and the script's name ;)).<br/>
# &nbsp; Check it out at https://github.com/mubix/netview<br/>
# &nbsp; The main difference with our approach is we keep <br/>
# &nbsp; looping over the hosts found and keep track of who logged<br/>
# &nbsp; in/out from remote servers. Plus, we keep the connections<br/>
# &nbsp; with the target systems and just send a few DCE-RPC packets.<br/>
#<br/>
# &nbsp; One VERY IMPORTANT thing is:<br/>
# &nbsp; <br/>
# &nbsp; YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RESOLV THE DOMAIN MACHINES NETBIOS <br/>
# &nbsp; NAMES. That's usually solved by setting your DNS to the <br/>
# &nbsp; domain DNS (and the right search domain).<br/>
# &nbsp; <br/>
# &nbsp; Some examples of usage are:<br/>
#<br/>
# &nbsp; netview.py -target 192.168.1.10 beto<br/>
# &nbsp; <br/>
# &nbsp; This will show the sessions on 192.168.1.10 and will authenticate as 'beto'<br/>
# &nbsp; (password will be prompted)<br/>
#<br/>
# &nbsp; netview.py FREEFLY.NET/beto<br/>
#<br/>
# &nbsp; This will download all machines from FREEFLY.NET, authenticated as 'beto'<br/>
# &nbsp; and will gather the session information for those machines that appear<br/>
# &nbsp; to be up. There is a background thread checking aliveness of the targets<br/>
# &nbsp; at all times.<br/>
#<br/>
# &nbsp; netview.py -users /tmp/users -dc-ip freefly-dc.freefly.net -k FREEFLY.NET/beto<br/>
# &nbsp;<br/>
# &nbsp; This will download all machines from FREEFLY.NET, authenticating using<br/>
# &nbsp; Kerberos (that's why -dc-ip parameter is needed), and filter<br/>
# &nbsp; the output based on the list of users specified in /tmp/users file.<br/>
<br/>
