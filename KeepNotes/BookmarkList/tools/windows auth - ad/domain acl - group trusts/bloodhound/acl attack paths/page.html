Version 1.3 of BloodHound introduced an exciting new feature which gives an attacker more options to exploit different Active Directory objects. Version 1.3 includes new edge types based on Active Directory object control. The update adds several new edges based on object permissions that BloodHound indicates as abusable. ACL-based attack paths identify exploitable object access control entries (ACE)s within discretionary access control Lists (DACL)s.</body></html>
