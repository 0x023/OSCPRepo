</head><body>BloodHound is a viable tool for performing risk audits for an Active Directory environment. The same attack paths used by an attacker can be identified and remediated by a defensive practitioner.<br/>
<br/>
Check out https://adsecurity.org/?p=3658 and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/securing-privileged-access-reference-material for an in depth look at Auditing privileged access.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BloodHoundâ€™s core components are data ingestion and visualization. As mentioned previously, BloodHound is a specialized version of Powerview. Powerview only needs version 2.0 of PowerShell to run, making it able to run on default configurations on machines running Windows 7 or later.<br/>
<br/>
The collection modules which PowerView uses to enumerate AD information do not require special permissions. These can be run by regular users on the network. Enumeration is done using LDAP via ADSI. Since there is traditionally no logging for these features, this makes detection of BloodHound increasingly difficult.<br/>
<br/>
We can see that BloodHound causes high volumes of LDAP traffic. An option for defensive practitioners is to monitor for this high volume of LDAP traffic and enable a rule to log this traffic.<br/>
<br/>
Network administrators can enable a rule that would log high volumes of LDAP traffic with LDAP sessions longer than traditional. It is best to baseline your network traffic and then observe the changes when running BloodHound.</body></html>
