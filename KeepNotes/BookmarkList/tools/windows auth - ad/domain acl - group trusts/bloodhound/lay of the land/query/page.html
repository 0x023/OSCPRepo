Once you have exported the data to CSV, download the files and upload them to BloodHound<br/>
Alternatively, you can export the data directly to the Neo4j REST API using the -URI and -UserPass arguments as described in the BloodHound Github <a href="https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/wiki/Ingestion-using-Common-C2-Frameworks">wiki</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Querying<br/>
BloodHound includes several powerful baked-in analytical queries. A notable query here is “shortest path to Domain Admins”.<br/>
<br/>
The example below displays the query “Find Top 10 users with the Most Admins”.<br/>

<br/>
BloodHound also includes custom node selection where a specified source, and target node are selected for attack path mapping. Perhaps you would like to skip finding a path to domain admin and would rather move straight to a database or the domain controller itself.<br/>
<br/>
You can select the compromised object as a start node and the target machine as an end node.<br/>
