<title>Visualize</title>
</head><body>ADCP uses the OVALI frontend to display JSON data files as graphs.<br/>
<br/>
Quick Start Open Visualize/index.html with a web brower (Chrome/Chromium is preferred). Open one of the generated json files.<br/>
<br/>
For better visibility, you might want to:<br/>
<br/>
right click -&gt; cluster some similar nodes<br/>
setup hierarchical viewing with the menu on the left, especially for email nodes as this will flatten Exchange RBAC nodes<br/>
disable physics if the graph does not stabilize<br/>
remove unwanted relationships or nodes with right click -&gt; "Cypher delete to clipboard" and paste into http://localhost:7474 then relaunch the query.</body></html>
