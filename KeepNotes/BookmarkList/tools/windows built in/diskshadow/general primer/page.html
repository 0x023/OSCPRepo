“DiskShadow.exe is a tool that exposes the functionality offered by the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS). &nbsp;By default, DiskShadow uses an interactive command interpreter similar to that of DiskRaid or DiskPart. &nbsp;DiskShadow also includes a scriptable mode.“<br/>
<br/>
DiskShadow is included in Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2016 and is a Windows signed binary.<br/>
<br/>
The VSS features of DiskShadow require privileged-level access (with UAC elevation), however, several command utilities can be invoked by a non-privileged user. &nbsp;This makes DiskShadow a very interesting candidate for command execution and evasive persistence.</body></html>
