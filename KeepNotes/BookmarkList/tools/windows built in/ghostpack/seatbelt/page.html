<title>Seatbelt</title>
</head><body>Seatbelt<br/>
Seatbelt is by far the meatiest project being released. It’s a clearinghouse of situational awareness “safety checks”. That is, it manages the collection of host data that may be interesting from both offensive and defensive perspectives. Think everything from PowerShell security settings, to current user Kerberos tickets, to deleted Recycle Bin items, and more (40+ current checks!)<br/>
<br/>
Seatbelt draws on a TON of existing work, highlighted in the README.md, and has already proven itself to be pretty useful on our engagements. It was heavily influenced by @tifkin_‘s <a href="https://github.com/leechristensen/Random/blob/master/PowerShellScripts/Get-HostProfile.ps1">Get-HostProfile.ps</a>1 and @andrewchiles‘ <a href="https://github.com/threatexpress/red-team-scripts/blob/master/HostEnum.ps1">HostEnum.ps1</a>&nbsp;PowerShell scripts.<br/>
<br/>

SeatBelt.exe all will run ALL enumeration checks, can be combined with full.<br/>
<br/>
SeatBelt.exe [CheckName] [CheckName2] … will run one or more specified checks only (case-sensitive naming!)<br/>
