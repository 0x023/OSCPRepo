<br/>
GhostPack is (currently) a collection various C# implementations of previous PowerShell functionality, and includes six separate toolsets being released today- <a href="https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt/">Seatbelt</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpUp/">SharpUp</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpDump/">SharpRoast</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpDump/">SharpDump</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GhostPack/SafetyKatz/">SafetyKatz</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpWMI/">SharpWMI</a>. All of these projects will be hosted on the <a href="http://github.com/GhostPack/">GhostPack</a>&nbsp;GitHub organization, with each project broken out as a separate repository.<br/>
<br/>
Quick sidenote: GhostPack is not intended to be only C# code, nor is it purely offensive, though the projects released today are all C#. The plan is to have the organization house a number of security-related projects that are not PowerShell. Additionally, to keep defenders from building brittle signatures (think flagging various author’s Twitter handles : ) we’re not currently planning to distribute binaries for any of the projects. However, everything is Visual Studio Community 2015 compatible, so it’s a snap to build yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Full disclosure: that’s almost nothing “new” here, just different implementations of the same techniques many have been using for years. Also, all code here should be considered beta- it’s had some testing but there are still plenty of bugs to be had :)</body></html>
