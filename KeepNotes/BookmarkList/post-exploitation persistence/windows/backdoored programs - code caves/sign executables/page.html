<title>Sign Executables</title>
</head><body>It is recommended to sign your executable, and if you can't afford to steal a trusted certificate, you can still import your own CA into the user's trusted certificate store (with user privileges), and it will look like a trusted one. Protip: Use "Microsoft Windows" as the code signer CA, and your executable will blend in.<br/>

Rootkit.exe totally looks legit, and it is filtered out when someone filters for "Hide Windows entries"</body></html>
