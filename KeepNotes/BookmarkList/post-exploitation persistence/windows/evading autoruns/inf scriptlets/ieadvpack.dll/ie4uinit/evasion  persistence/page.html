<title>Evasion &amp; Persistence</title>
</head><body>For good measure (and deception), we copy the respective files to C:\Windows\Tasks\ &nbsp;since any “authenticated user” can write to this directory by default. &nbsp;Now, let’s perform a proof-of-concept exercise in persistence and evasion (in an AutoRuns context) by creating a Run Key for IE4uinit:<br/>
<br/>
REG ADD "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /V "IEinit" /t REG_SZ /F ?D "C:\Windows\Tasks\ie4uinit.exe -BaseSettings"<br/>
<br/>
After opening the AutoRuns program and removing the Hide Windows Entries filter, we drill down to our Run Key entry<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
To the untrained or impatient eye, our proof-of-concept Run Key seems pretty convincing. &nbsp;IE4uinit is a signed Microsoft Windows Binary, and C:\windows\Tasks is a an interesting directory (especially if &nbsp;opted for a Schedule Task instead). &nbsp; Most importantly, take note that there is absolutely no visible evidence of our modified INF file (with SCT payload) even when the Windows Entries filter is removed. &nbsp;After logging back into the machine, our SCT payload launches calc.exe.</body></html>
