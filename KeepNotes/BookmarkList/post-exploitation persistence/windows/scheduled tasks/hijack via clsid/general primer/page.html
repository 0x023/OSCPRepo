</head><body>Some scheduled tasks have their action set as "Custom Handler"<br/>
You can view the action by pulling the XML<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;schtasks /query /XML /TN "\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\Automatic App Update"<br/>

There is a ComHandler associated with the task's action. This means that when the task runs, it reaches out to HKCR:\CLSID\{A6BA00FE-40E8-477C-B713-C64A14F18ADB}\I&lt;SubKey&gt;<br/>
and runs whatever DLL is specified<br/>

<br/>
Due to permissions, you can &nbsp;only hijack HKCU unless you have elevated privileges to hijack HKLM<br/>
By adding your key and it's subkey and adding our own DLL, the Scheduled Task will run whatever we put there.<br/>
<br/>
You can use Get-ScheduledTaskComHandler to see tasks you can potentially hijack<br/>
You can also specify tasks that are set to execute on logon by specifying -OnLogon<br/>
You can specify -PersistenceLocations to show only Scheduled Tasks that execute in userland AND start on logon</body></html>
