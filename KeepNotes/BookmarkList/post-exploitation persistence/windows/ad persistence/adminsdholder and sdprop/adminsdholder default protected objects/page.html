<title>AdminSDHolder Default Protected Objects</title>
</head><body>SDProp Protected Objects (Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2):<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Account Operators<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Administrator<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Administrators<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Backup Operators<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Domain Admins<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Domain Controllers<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Enterprise Admins<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Krbtgt<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Print Operators<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Read-only Domain Controllers<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Replicator<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Schema Admins<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Server Operators<br/>
<br/>
A subset of these groups can be excluded from control, including Account Operators, Server Operators, Print Operators, Backup Operators.<br/>
<br/>
Around 60 minutes later, the PDC Emulator runs and the account now has full control on the Domain Admins group.<br/>
<br/>
Or, run SDPRop manually.<br/>

&nbsp; &nbsp; In Windows Server 2008 R2, Microsoft introduced a new rootDSE LDAP modify operation, called RunProtectAdminGroupsTask, to start the AdminSDHolder process.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The new Windows 2008 R2 RunProtectAdminGroupsTask-based mechanism provides a more efficient mechanism to enforce AdminSDHolder application. Under the hood, the older FixUpInheritance-based mechanism doesn’t really kick off the AdminSDHolder process—it starts the Security Descriptor Propagator Update (SDProp) process. SDProp has the same effect on the ACLs of critical security groups and accounts but takes much longer to complete. SDProp is the background AD process that propagates changes of inheritable ACEs on parent objects to their child objects. It’s automatically triggered when an object’s ACL is modified or when an object is moved. SDProp affects all AD child objects’ ACLs and not only the ACLs of critical AD security groups and accounts and will thus consume much more DC processing time.<br/>
