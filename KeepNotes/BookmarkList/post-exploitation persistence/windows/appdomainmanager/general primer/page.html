</head><body>CLR:<br/>
The full name Common Language Runtime is a runtime environment that can be used by many programming languages.<br/>
<br/>
The CLR is the main execution engine of the .NET Framework. One of its functions is to monitor the running of the program:<br/>
<ul><li>Programs that run under CLR monitoring are "managed" code</li>
<li>An application or component that is not running directly on the bare metal under the CLR is an "unmanaged" code</li>
</ul>
<br/>
For programs under CLR monitoring, the initialization process of program startup can refer to the following <a href="http://mattwarren.org/2017/02/07/The-68-things-the-CLR-does-before-executing-a-single-line-of-your-code/">link</a>:<br/>
<br/>
One of the interesting things I stumbled on was this reference to <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/clr-configuration-knobs.md">CLR tuning</a>:<br/>
<br/>
Of particular interest I saw these environment variables that can be set. You can also set these in an app.config file.<br/>

<br/>
AppDomain Managers are interesting in that they setup the environment, before your .NET app runs.<br/>
<br/>
I'll keep this short. &nbsp;You can manipulate the runtime, by getting your code to execute prior to the application.<br/>
