<title>Hypervisor - Ring 1</title>
</head><body>This is somewhat special, because I believe although rootkit can run in this layer but it can't persist only in this layer on an average, physical machine, because it won't survive a reboot <a href="http://blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-06/BH-US-06-Rutkowska.pdf">See Rutkowska's presentation from 2006</a>&nbsp;But because the hypervisor can intercept the restart event, it can write itself into one of the other layers (e.g. install a common kernel driver), and simple delete it after it is fully functional after reboot. Update: There is a good paper from Igor Korkin about hypervisor detection <a href="http://igorkorkin.blogspot.ru/2015/05/two-challenges-of-stealthy-hypervisors.html">here</a>.</body></html>
