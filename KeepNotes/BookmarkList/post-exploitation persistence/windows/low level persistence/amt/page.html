<br/>
<br/>
According to Wikipedia, "Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) is hardware and firmware technology for remote out-of-band management of personal computers, in order to monitor, maintain, update, upgrade, and repair them". You can ask, what could possible go wrong? See <a href="http://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/bh09usa/Ring%20-3%20Rootkits.pdf">Alexander Tereshkin's and Rafal Wojtczuk's great research on this</a>, or <a href="http://people.kth.se/~maguire/DEGREE-PROJECT-REPORTS/100402-Vassilios_Ververis-with-cover.pdf">Vassilios Ververis thesis about AMT</a>. <br/>
<br/>
As not many people click on links, let me quote the scary stuff about AMT:<ul><li>Independent of main CPU</li>
<li>Can access host memory via DMA (with restrictions)</li>
<li>Dedicated link to NIC, and its filtering capabilities</li>
<li>Can force host OS to reboot at any time (and boot the system from the emulated CDROM)</li>
<li>Active even in S3 sleep!</li>
</ul>
