<title>Master Boot Record</title>
</head><body>Malware can overwrite the Master boot record, start the boot process with it's own code, and continue the boot process with the original one. It is common for rootkits to fake the content of the MBR record, and show the original contents. Which means one just have attach the infected HDD to a clean system, and compare the first 512 bytes (or more in some cases) with a known, clean state, or compare it to the contents shown from the infected OS. SecureBoot can be used to prevent malware infection like this.</body></html>
