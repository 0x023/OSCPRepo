COM (Component Object Model) is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms694363%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">described by Microsoft</a>&nbsp;as “platform-independent, distributed, object-oriented system for creating binary software components that can interact”. The purpose of this technology is to provide an interface to allow developers to control and manipulate objects of other applications. We already spoke about this technology in the IcoScript case. Each COM object is defined by a unique ID called CLSID. For example the CLSID to create an instance of Internet Explorer is {0002DF01-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}.</body></html>
