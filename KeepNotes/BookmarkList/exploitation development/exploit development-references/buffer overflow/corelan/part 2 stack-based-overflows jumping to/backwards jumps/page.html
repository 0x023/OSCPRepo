<title>Backwards Jumps</title>
</head><body><br/>
In the event you need to perform backward jumps (jump with a negative offset) : get the negative number and convert it to hex. Take the dword hex value and use that as argument to a jump (\xeb or \xe9)<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Example : jump back 7 bytes : -7 = FFFFFFF9, so jump -7 would be "\xeb\xf9\xff\xff"<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Exampe : jump back 400 bytes : -400 = FFFFFE70, so jump -400 bytes = "\xe9\x70\xfe\xff\xff" (as you can see, this opcode is 5 bytes long. Sometimes (if you need to stay within a dword size (4 byte limit), then you may need to perform multiple shorter jumps in order to get where you want to be)<br/>
