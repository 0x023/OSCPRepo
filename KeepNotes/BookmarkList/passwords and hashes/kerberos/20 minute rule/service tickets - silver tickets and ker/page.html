<title>Service Tickets / Silver Tickets and Kerberos</title>
</head><body>Service Tickets and Kerberos <br/>
The obvious question now arises, what do we need to issue a service ticket for a particular service? &nbsp;How can we take advantage of this?<br/>
<br/>
Service tickets SHOULD be issued by a TGS after getting a TGT and should be between 2 Kerberos principals. &nbsp;So for example, if Bob wants to access a file share (CIFS) on ServerA, Bob would ask the TGS to give him a ticket for user CIFS@ServerA. &nbsp;The TGS would then give Bob a ticket that he could present to ServerA that would give him access to the CIFS service.<br/>
<br/>
With TGTs, the piece destined for the TGS would need to be signed by the KRBTGT account, the central account for trust to validate that the ticket is legit. &nbsp;However, for service tickets, the target account is on the computer itself. &nbsp;What is the long term secret key? &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
In short, it depends. &nbsp;For all services that run as System on the computer, it will be the computer account from AD. &nbsp; If the service is operating as a particular user (typically like Sharepoint, Exchange, &nbsp;MSSQL, etc...) it will be that account. <br/>
<br/>
Recovering the computer account is relatively trivial with physical access (think boot disk, grab the registry, decode at whim) and if you can run as admin, it's trivial as well... &nbsp;If you can guess the service account password for a service that runs as a different user, that will work too...<br/>
<br/>
Now, all you have to do is use Mimikatz to generate a Silver Ticket for the service and away you go...<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;Since service tickets are identical in format to TGTs albeit with a different service name, all you need to do is specify a different service name and use the RC4 (NTLM hash) of the account password (either the computer account for default services or the actual account) and you can now issue service tickets for the requested service. &nbsp;Note: &nbsp;You can also use the AES keys if you happen to have them instead of the NTLM key and it will still work ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting, that services like MSSQL, Sharepoint, etc will only allow you to play with those services. &nbsp;The computer account will allow access to CIFS, service creation, and a whole host of other activities on the targeted computer. &nbsp;You can leverage the computer account into a shell with PSEXEC and you will be running as system on that particular computer. &nbsp;Lateral movement is then a matter of doing whatever you need to do from there</body></html>
