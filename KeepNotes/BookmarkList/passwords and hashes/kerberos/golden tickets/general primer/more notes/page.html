</head><body>A "Golden Ticket" is a <i>homemade</i>&nbsp;ticket<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;It's made with a lot of love<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;and a key<br/>
<br/>
It's not made by the KDC so: <br/>
&nbsp;&#09;It's not limited by GPO or other settings<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;You can push whatever you want inside<br/>
&nbsp; &#09;It's smartcard independent<br/>
<br/>
But a golden ticket is not only about lifetime modification (10 years is hardcoded, but can be modified)<br/>
Interesting part is about to modify data into, life lifetime, but mainly the Microsoft PAC:<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Groups (Domain/Enterprise Admins, by example)<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;SID<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Username<br/>
<br/>
Kerberos is Stateless<br/>
All account policy info is in the TGT<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Disabled / Expired /Outside of logon hours<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Password expired<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Authentication silo membership<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;"Protected Users" is just a group membership in the PAC<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Group Membership in the PAC<br/>
This means that ALL account policy &nbsp;is <i>Client Side Enforced</i><br/>
<br/>
