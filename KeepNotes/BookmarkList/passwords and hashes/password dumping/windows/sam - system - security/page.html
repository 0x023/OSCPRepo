</head><body>1 â€“ Dumping the SAM file &nbsp;<br/>
This is probably the most common way to escalate privileges. Often, it is possible to retrieve the LM hashes from a system thatmay include some domain credentials. <br/>

It is also possible to utilize theshadow copy feature from Microsoft Systems to get the "SYSKEY" and "SAM" files. One of thepossible tools that could be used for this is hobocopy.<br/>
