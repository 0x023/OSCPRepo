<title>Contents of a Digest Response</title>
</head><body>&nbsp;The client must send the server a Digest challenge response when it receives a Digest challenge in response to a request for a resource. The client must send the request again, supplying an Authorization header with the challenge response. The following table describes the directives that make up a Digest challenge response.<br/>
<br/>
Directive&#09;&#09;Description<br/>
username&#09;The account name of the security principal requesting the resource.<br/>
Realm&#09;&#09;The name of the domain that contains the account indicated by username.<br/>
nonce&#09;&#09;The nonce received in the Digest challenge.<br/>
uri&#09;&#09;&#09;The Universal Resource Identifier (URI) of the requested resource.<br/>
qop&#09;&#09;&#09;The quality of protection.<br/>
nc&#09;&#09;&#09;The nonce count. The number of times the client has sent a challenge response using the nonce. For more information, see the nonce directive.<br/>
cnonce&#09;&#09;A unique encoded value generated by the client for each challenge response.<br/>
response&#09;&#09;A value computed according to the Digest Access specification (RFC 2617). An accurate response is conclusive proof that the user's password is known on the client side.<br/>
algorithm&#09;The algorithm received in the Digest challenge.<br/>
opaque&#09;&#09;The opaque value received in the Digest challenge.<br/>
(SASL only) cipher&#09;One of the cipher values received in the Digest challenge. For cipher details, see Quality of Protection and Ciphers.<br/>
<br/>

Microsoft Digest supports the following username/Realm forms:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Username Realm<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; AccountName Domain (flat)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; UPN "" (blank)<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; NetBIOS "" (blank)<br/>
<br/>
While uppercase characters are supported, for best performance matching the server's precalculated Digest hash values, the use of lowercase characters is recommended.<br/>
<br/>
The use of precalculated hashes is a new feature that allows system operators to skip the use of reversible encrypted passwords on the domain controller. A precalculated hash is formed for a user when the user's password is changed.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft Digest generates the Digest challenge response string for client applications. For details, see Generating the Digest Challenge Response.</body></html>
