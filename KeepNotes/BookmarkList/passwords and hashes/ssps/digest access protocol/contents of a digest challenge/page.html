<title>Contents of a Digest Challenge</title>
</head><body>&nbsp;The size of a Digest Access challenge must be less than 2048 bytes. The following example shows a challenge assigned to the character string szChallenge.<br/>
<br/>
C++<br/>
<br/>
szChallenge = "realm=\"Microsoft_Example_Forest\",";<br/>
algorithm = "MD5-sess\", qop=\"auth\", nonce=\"0123456789abcdef\"";<br/>
<br/>
Note &nbsp;The challenge string is enclosed in double quotes and contains embedded double quotes. Embedded double quotes must be preceded (escaped) with a backslash (\).<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
A Digest challenge can contain the following directives.<br/>
Directive&#09;&#09;Description<br/>
realm&#09;&#09;An implementation-defined hint to the client about which credentials are required. The client should display this information to the user if it is prompting for credentials.<br/>
algorithm&#09;Microsoft Digest supports MD5 and MD5-Sess. For optimal performance, use MD5-Sess.<br/>
qop&#09;&#09;&#09;This directive can be set to auth, auth-int, or auth-conf. For more information, see Quality of Protection and Ciphers.<br/>
nonce&#09;&#09;A unique encoded value generated by the server for each challenge. This value must not be altered by the client.<br/>
opaque&#09;&#09;Contains a reference for the security context that is being established. For more information, see Maintaining the Security Context Between Connections.<br/>
cipher(SASL only) &#09;The list of ciphers that the server supports. This element can be present in a Digest SASL challenge only if the qop directive specifies auth-conf. For more information, see Quality of Protection and Ciphers.<br/>
charset&#09;&#09;This directive can be set to utf-8 if the server can process UTF-8–encoded user names and realms. If the client understands the charset directive, it can respond by using UTF-8–encoded values.</body></html>
