<title>Protected Process Light</title>
</head><body><span style="font-size: 10pt"><br/>
Before taking a look at how to enable the mitigation, let’s see what makes a PPL tick. Unlike the simple “ProtectedProcess” bit in EPROCESS that I documented in Vista, a Windows 8.1 EPROCESS structure now has a “Protection” field of the following type:<br/>
_PS_PROTECTION<br/>
&nbsp; +0x000 Level &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: UChar<br/>
&nbsp; +0x000 Type &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : Pos 0, 3 Bits<br/>
&nbsp; +0x000 Audit &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: Pos 3, 1 Bit<br/>
&nbsp; +0x000 Signer &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : Pos 4, 4 Bits<br/>
<br/>
Where type can be one of the following:<br/>
_PS_PROTECTED_TYPE<br/>
&nbsp; PsProtectedTypeNone = 0n0<br/>
&nbsp; PsProtectedTypeProtectedLight = 0n1<br/>
&nbsp; PsProtectedTypeProtected = 0n2<br/>
&nbsp; PsProtectedTypeMax = 0n3<br/>
<br/>
and Signer can be one of these (excited about some of these other values? future blog posts will uncover more on signers and PPLs):<br/>
_PS_PROTECTED_SIGNER<br/>
&nbsp; PsProtectedSignerNone = 0n0<br/>
&nbsp; PsProtectedSignerAuthenticode = 0n1<br/>
&nbsp; PsProtectedSignerCodeGen = 0n2<br/>
&nbsp; PsProtectedSignerAntimalware = 0n3<br/>
&nbsp; PsProtectedSignerLsa = 0n4<br/>
&nbsp; PsProtectedSignerWindows = 0n5<br/>
&nbsp; PsProtectedSignerWinTcb = 0n6<br/>
&nbsp; PsProtectedSignerMax = 0n7<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let’s do some quick math and see if the LSASS process on my hardened Windows 8.1 system matches:<br/>
lkd&gt; !process 0 0 lsass.exe<br/>
PROCESS ffffe000049ab900<br/>
lkd&gt; ?? ((nt!_EPROCESS*)0xffffe000049ab900)-&gt;Protection.Level<br/>
unsigned char 0x41'<br/>
<br/>
Because the bits are essentially nibbles, it’s easy to read 0x41 as Lsa (0x4) + PPL (0x1).<br/>
<br/>
Once a process is in the PPL state, all the protections in <a href="http://www.alex-ionescu.com/?p=34">my previous blog post</a>&nbsp;are in effect — the system protects both types of protected processes in the same way, preventing any handle open for all but a few limited rights. Additionally, the memory manager will prevent loading of DLLs that are not signed appropriately, using the Code Integrity improvements in Windows 8 that I covered in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&ved=0CDgQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fruxconbreakpoint.com%2Fassets%2FUploads%2Fbpx%2Falex-breakpoint2012.pdf&ei=r8KPUqzgCtDnoASjnYDoCw&usg=AFQjCNGNjRCsmNw-vHoRwj9gp15NB1pF1Q&sig2=O3nehmZKE5etgoXNfBbDFA&bvm=bv.56988011,d.cGU">my talk</a>&nbsp;at BreakPoint last year — something I plan to revisit in this blog at a later time.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, although I didn’t mention this back in the Vista days, the application compatibility database is also disabled for these processes — an interesting attack vector that is blocked thanks to this.<br/>

<span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: sans">Regarding Process Protected Light (PPL)<br/>
</span></span><span style="color: #000000"><span style="font-family: sans"><div style="text-align: justify">Either way, as long as one of these two things is set (the environment variable or the registry key), </div><i><a href="http://www.alex-ionescu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/execsystem.png">ExecSystemProcesses</a></i><a href="http://www.alex-ionescu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/execsystem.png"> </a><div style="text-align: justify">will call </div><i><a href="http://www.alex-ionescu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/start.png">StartSystemProcess</a></i><a href="http://www.alex-ionescu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/start.png"> </a><div style="text-align: justify">with the CREATE_PROTECTED_PROCESS flag. In turn, the routine will utilize the new Vista Process/Thread Attribute List functionality to add attribute 0x2000B — documented as the new Windows 8.1 “</div><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686880(v=vs.85).aspx">Protection Level Attribute</a><div style="text-align: justify">“. As you can expect, the level is set to 4, which matches the “LSA Signer” enumeration value above. And just like that, LSASS is now a PPL, and protected against even an admin (or even SYSTEM) attacker. And no, not even SE_DEBUG_PRIVILEGE will get you through</div>&nbsp; </span></span><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Should you run off and set that registry key? Yes and no. Once LSASS runs as a PPL, this will break any 3rd party software that might be attempting to inject or modify LSASS state. And sadly, at work, I’ve seen a number of these. Additionally, LSASS has a number of extensibility points, some used as ASEPs by attackers, others used legitimately to provide enhanced security or cryptographic services. Without the right signature and EKU (which right now means a WHQL signature with Microsoft as the signer — not just any Authenticode garbage!), those DLLs, plugins, and extensions will stop working. In certain IT scenarios, this can be a catastrophic compatibility problem, no doubt why Microsoft has chosen to keep this disabled for now.<br/>
<br/>
But on a home computer, where you know you don’t have specialized software, and you firmly believe that AV (and others) should leave your LSASS alone? I’d say go for it. A number of helpful event log entries in the Security log will warn you of any DLLs that failed to load in case you’re curious.<br/>
