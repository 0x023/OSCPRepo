<title>Advice / Time Savers</title>
</head><body>Advice:<ul><li>I also made sure to have a nice page of “quick scripts” that I could copy and paste into a terminal, such as a wget <b>powershell script</b>, <b>ftp download script</b>, etc… These were all from techniques I used in the labs.</li>
<li>Lesson learned: Have a process, know your process, stick to your process.</li>
<li>Check firewall/IPTable rules (or remove them)</li>
<li>tmux or split terminal windows, reduce the need and complexity of terminal tabs</li>
<li>For the love of God, please take good notes from the beginning. My note taking was atrocious, by the time the exam rolled around I had to go back and re-root 10 unique machines from scratch because my notes were so bad, all so I could document my steps to get an extra 5 bonus points. This is the last thing you need to be doing before an exam attempt.</li>
<li>Time management: Schedule early and pull an all nighter? OR schedule later at night and work, sleep, last few hours work refreshed</li>
</ul>
