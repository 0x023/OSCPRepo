<title>Explore Further</title>
</head><body>By now, we would have information about what ports are open and possibly what services are running on them. Further, we need to explore the various options by which we can get more information.<br/>
<br/>
Gathering Screenshots for http* services:<br/>
There are four ways (in my knowledge to do this)<ul><li>http-screenshot NSE:</li>
<li>Nmap has a NSE script <a href="https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Nmap-Tools/blob/master/NSE/http-screenshot.nse">http-screenshot</a>. This could be executed while running nmap. It uses wkhtml2image tool in the script. Sometimes, you may find that running this script takes a long time. It might be a good idea to gather all the http* running IP, Port and provide this information to wkhtml2image directly via scripting. You do have to install wkhtml2image and test with disable javascript and other options available.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/breenmachine/httpscreenshot">httpscreenshot</a>&nbsp;from breenmachine: httpscreenshot is a tool for grabbing screenshots and HTML of large numbers of websites. The goal is for it to be both thorough and fast which can sometimes oppose each other.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ChrisTruncer/EyeWitness">Eyewitness</a>&nbsp;from Chris Truncer: EyeWitness is designed to take screenshots of websites, provide some server header info, and identify default credentials if possible.</li>
<li>Another method is to use <a href="https://code.google.com/p/java-html2image/">html2image</a>&nbsp;which is a simple Java library converts plain HTML markup to image and provides client-side image-map using HTML element.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Information gathering for http* services:<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://bitbucket.org/al14s/rawr/wiki/Home">RAWR</a>: Rapid Assesment of Web Resourses: RAWR provides with a customizable CSV containing ordered information gathered for each host, with a field for making notes/etc.; An elegant, searchable, JQuery-driven HTML report that shows screenshots, diagrams, and other information. A report on relevent security headers. In short, it provides a landscape of your webapplications. It takes input from multiple formats such as Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS etc.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.morningstarsecurity.com/research/whatweb">WhatWeb</a>&nbsp;recognises web technologies including content management systems (CMS), blogging platforms, statistic/analytics packages, JavaScript libraries, web servers, and embedded device. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/Tellmeweb">Tellmeweb</a>&nbsp;is a ruby script to read Nmap Gnmap file and run whatweb on all of them. A <a href="https://github.com/stevecoward/whatweb-parser">WhatWeb Result Parser</a>&nbsp;also has been written which converts the results to CSV format. More information about advance usage can be found here.</li>
<li><a href="http://wappalyzer.com/">Wapplyzer</a>&nbsp;is a Firefox plug-in. It works only on regular expression matching and doesn't need anything other than the page to be loaded on browser. It works completely at the browser level and gives results in the form of icons.</li>
<li><a href="http://w3techs.com/">W3Tech</a>&nbsp;is another Chrome plug-in which provides information about the usage of various types of technologies on the web. It tells the web technologies based on the crawling it has done. So example.com, x1.example.com, x2.example.com will show the same technologies as the domain is same (which is not correct).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/justjavac/ChromeSnifferPlus">ChromeSnifferPlus</a>&nbsp;is another chrome extension to sniff about the different web-technologies used by the website.</li>
<li><a href="http://builtwith.com/">BuiltWith</a>&nbsp;is another website which provides a good amount of information about the different technologies used by website.</li>
</ul>
