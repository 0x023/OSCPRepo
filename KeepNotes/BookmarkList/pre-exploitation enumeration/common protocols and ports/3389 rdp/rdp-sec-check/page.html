Overview<br/>
rdp-sec-check is a Perl script to enumerate the different security settings of an remote destktop service (AKA Terminal Services).<br/>
<br/>
It does not require authentication, only network connectivity to TCP port 3389.<br/>
<br/>
It can determine many (though not quite all) of the security settings from the RDP-Tcp Properties | General tab:<br/>
<ul><li>Check which security layers are supported by the service: Standard RDP Security, TLSv1.0, CredSSP</li>
<li>For Standard RDP Security it detects the level of encryption supported: 40-bit, 56-bit, 128-bit, FIPS</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The following potential security issues are flagged if present:<br/>
<ul><li>The service supports Standard RDP Security – rhis is known to be vulnerable to an active “Man-In-The-Middle” attack</li>
<li>The service supports weak encryption (40-bit or 56-bit)</li>
<li>The service does not mandate Network Level Authentication (NLA) - NLA can help to prevent certain types of Denial of Service attack</li>
<li>The service supports FIPS encryption but doesn’t mandate it – may only be interesting for jurisdictions where FIPS is required</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Requirements<br/>
rdp-sec-check is a simple Perl script that requires one module from CPAN. Run ‘cpan’ as root then install the Encoding::BER module:<br/>
<br/>
# cpan<br/>
cpan[1]&gt; install Encoding::BER</body></html>
