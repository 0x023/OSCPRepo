</head><body>Reverse DNS Lookup using External Websites: Even after doing the above, sometimes we miss few of the domain name. Example: Recently, In one of our engagement, the domain name was example.com and the asn netblock was 192.168.0.0/24. We did recon-ng, theharvester, DNS reverse-lookup via nmap. Still, we missed few of the websites hosted on same netblock but with different domain such as exam.in. We can find such entries by using ReverseIP lookup by<ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170113213434/http://reverseip.domaintools.com/">Reverse IP Lookup by Domaintools</a>: Domain name search tool that allows a wildcard search, monitoring of WHOIS record changes and history caching, as well as Reverse IP queries.</li>
