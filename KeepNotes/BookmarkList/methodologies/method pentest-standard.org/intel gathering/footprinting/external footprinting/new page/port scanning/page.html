<title>Port Scanning</title>
</head><body>==== Port Scanning ====<br/>
Port scanning techniques will vary based on the amount of time available for the test, and the need to be stealthy. If there is zero knowledge of the systems, a fast ping scan can be used to identify systems. In addition, a quick scan without ping verification (-PN in nmap) should be run to detect the most common ports avialable. Once this is complete, a more comprehensive scan can be run. Some testers check for only open TCP ports, make sure to check UDP as well. The http://nmap.org/nmap_doc.html document details port scan types. &nbsp;Nmap ("Network Mapper") is the de facto standard for network auditing/scanning. &nbsp;Nmap runs on both Linux and Windows.<br/>
<br/>
You can find more information on the use of Nmap for this purpose in the [http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/PTES_Technical_Guidelines#Nmap_.28Windows.2FLinux.29 PTES Technical Guideline]<br/>
<br/>
Nmap has dozens of options available. &nbsp;Since this section is dealing with port scanning, we will focus on the commands required to perform this task. &nbsp;It is important to note that the commands utilized depend mainly on the time and number of hosts being scanned. &nbsp;The more hosts or less time that you have to perform this tasks, the less that we will interrogate the host. &nbsp;This will become evident as we continue to discuss the options.<br/>
<br/>
IPv6 should also be tested.</body></html>
