<br/>
ln -s /root/ /var/dir/being_backed_up<br/>
ln /home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys /var/file_I_have_sudoedit_access_to<br/>
<br/>
links are a awesome!<br/>
<br/>
Just remember the differences between symbolic and normal links<br/>
<br/>
A hard link then just creates another file with a link to the same underlying inode. When you delete a file it removes one link to the underlying inode. The inode is only deleted (or deletable/over-writable) when all links to the inode have been deleted. <br/>
A symbolic link is a link to another name in the file system.<br/>
For linking directories, you have to use a -s symbolic or soft link</body></html>
