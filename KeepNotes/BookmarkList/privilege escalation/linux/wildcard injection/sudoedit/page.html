<title>Sudoedit</title>
</head><body>Taken from the Joker HTB machine. <br/>
Versions of sudoedit are vulnerable to /*/* double wildcard vulnerability where the paths are not correctly checked<br/>
<br/>
Follow through with IppSec: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wyvpJa9LdU <br/>
<br/>
Two ways:<br/>
<br/>
symlink<br/>
sudoedit was allowed for /var/www/*/*/layout.html<br/>
so in /var/www, create a nested dir, say testing/ippsec<br/>
now, symlink to a file you want to chage and name it layout.html<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">&nbsp;&#09;ln /home/arekos/.ssh/authorized_keys layout.html</li>
</ul>
Now, you can edit layout.html as it fulfills all requirements by sudoedit, and place your public key in authorized_keys<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;$ /var/www/testing/ippsec: sudoedit -u arekos layout.html<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
abusing spacing<br/>
wildcards are awesome because they accept...well...anything!<br/>
Nano has the ability to create multiple files separated by space on the command line<br/>
take advantage of sudoedit directly:<br/>
$ cd /home/arekos<br/>
$ sudoedit -u arekos /var/www/ .ssh/authorized_keys /layout.html<br/>
<br/>
sudoedit requirements /var/www/*/*/layout.html were fulfilled and nano obliged and created /home/arekos/.ssh/authorized_keys AND layout.html. Simply save authorized_keys, exit out of layout.html and you're good to go!</body></html>
