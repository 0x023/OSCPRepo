Linking methods<ul><li><u><b>Implicitly</b></u> by gathering the shared objects in some directories and make the system load and link them automatically at program startup;</li>
<li><b><u>Explicitly</u></b> by making the program load and link the shared objects thanks to some library services (i.e. libdl.so). </li>
</ul>
Which ever the way we load and link the shared objects (implicitly or explicitly), it appears that the best way to make shared objects is to use "g++ -shared" and not "ld -shared". This makes the shared object prepared to run the static constructors at loading time and the static destructors at unloading time.<br/>
