<title>Use dev/shm instead of tmp</title>
</head><body>https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/what-is-devshm-and-its-practical-usage.html<br/>
<br/>
Use /dev/shm instead of tmp to avoid touching disk!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
shm / shmfs is also known as tmpfs, which is a common name for a temporary file storage facility on many Unix-like operating systems. It is intended to appear as a mounted file system, but one which uses virtual memory instead of a persistent storage device.<br/>
<br/>
If you type the mount command you will see /dev/shm as a tempfs file system. Therefore, it is a file system, which keeps all files in virtual memory. Everything in tmpfs is temporary in the sense that no files will be created on your hard drive. If you unmount a tmpfs instance, everything stored therein is lost. By default almost all Linux distros configured to use /dev/shm:<br/>
