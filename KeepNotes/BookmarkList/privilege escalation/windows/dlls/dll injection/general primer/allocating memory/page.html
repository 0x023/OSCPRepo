<title>Allocating Memory</title>
</head><body>Before we can inject anything into another process, we'll need a place to put it. We'll use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366890%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">VirtualAllocEx</a>() function to do so. <br/>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366890%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">VirtualAllocEx</a>() takes an amount of memory to allocate as one of its parameters. If we use LoadLibraryA(), we'll allocate spcae for the full path of the DLL and if we jump into the DllMain, we'll allocate space for the DLL's full contents. <br/>
<br/>
DLL Path<br/>
Allocating space for just the DLL path slightly reduces the amount of code you'll need to write but not by much. It also requires you to use the LoadLibraryA() method which has some downsides (described in general). That being said, it is a very popular method. <br/>
<br/>
Use VirtualAllocEx() and allocate enough memory to support a string which contains the path to the DLL:<br/>
GetFullPathName(TEXT("somedll.dll"), <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BUFSIZE, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dllPath, //Output to save the full DLL path<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NULL);<br/>
<br/>
dllPathAddr = VirtualAllocEx(hHandle, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;strlen(dllPath), <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MEM_RESERVE|MEM_COMMIT, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE);<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Full DLL:<br/>
Allocating space for the full DLL requires a little more code however it's also much more reliable and doesn't need to use LoadlibraryA(). <br/>
<br/>
First, open a handle to the DLL with CreateFileA() then calculate its size with GetFileSize() and pass it to VirtualAllocEx():<br/>
GetFullPathName(TEXT("somedll.dll"), <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BUFSIZE, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dllPath, //Output to save the full DLL path<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NULL);<br/>
<br/>
hFile = CreateFileA( dllPath, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;GENERIC_READ, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NULL, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;OPEN_EXISTING, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NULL );<br/>
<br/>
dllFileLength = GetFileSize( hFile, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;NULL );<br/>
<br/>
remoteDllAddr = VirtualAllocEx( hProcess, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NULL, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dllFileLength, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MEM_RESERVE|MEM_COMMIT, <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE );<br/>
