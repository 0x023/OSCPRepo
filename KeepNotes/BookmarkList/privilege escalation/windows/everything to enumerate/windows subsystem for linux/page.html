<title>Windows Subsystem For Linux</title>
</head><body>There is another whole filesystem inside Windows now (if it's installed). <br/>
Everything under Linux (except for kernel) enumeration now goes. <br/>
<br/>
Typically in Windows, this is limited to sensitive files since even "root" is a limited account. <br/>
<br/>
Execution of binaries may not be tracked or blocked under wsl (either linux execution or exe execution through Wine)<br/>
<br/>
There could be multiple operating systems<br/>
bash_history files<br/>
configs<br/>
etc</body></html>
