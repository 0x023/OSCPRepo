</head><body>If you have a GUI with a user that is included in <b>Administrators</b>&nbsp;group you first need to open up cmd.exe for the administrator. Open up the cmd from c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe. This will give you a cmd with Administrators rights.<br/>

Escalate to SYSTEM from Administrator<br/>
#Get time of machine<br/>
time<br/>
#Schedule task with 'at'<br/>
at 01:23 /interactive cmd.exe<br/>
<br/>
This is possible in XP- because scheduled tasks run as SYSTEM!<br/>

<b>Kitrap</b><br/>
On some machines the at 20:20 trick does not work. It never works on Windows 2003 for example. Instead you can use Kitrap. Upload both files and execute vdmaillowed.exe. I think it only works with GUI.<br/>
