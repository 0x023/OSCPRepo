</head><body>0x04 – Proof of concept<br/>
To abuse the driver loading privilege, a PoC application has been created in order to automate the procedure described above.<br/>
<br/>
A starting point is a non-privileged user (test) to which the privilege “Load and unload device drivers” has been assigned.<br/>
<br/>
As discussed earlier, initially the user will be assigned a restricted token, which does not include the SeLoadDriverPrivilege privilege.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you have an interactive session, you can perform the elevation token elevation by accepting the UAC prompt, otherwise you should use some <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1088">UAC bypassing technique</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In this specific case we assume that there is an interactive session in the system. By using the tool elevate, a new terminal with an associated unrestricted token can be spawned, after accepting the UAC prompt.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see the privilege “SeLoadDriverPrivilege” is present in the user’s access token, however it is disabled.<br/>

<br/>
At this point we can use the PoC tool EOPLOADDRIVER (<a href="https://github.com/TarlogicSecurity/EoPLoadDriver/">https://github.com/TarlogicSecurity/EoPLoadDriver/</a>), which will allow us to:<br/>
<ul><li>Enable the <b>SeLoadDriverPrivilege</b> privilege</li>
<li>Create the registry key under HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU) and set driver configuration settings</li>
<li>Execute the <b>NTLoadDriver</b> function, specifying the registry key previously created</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;<br/>
The tool can be invoked as shown below:<br/>
<br/>
EOPLOADDRIVER.exe RegistryKey DriverImagePath<br/>
<br/>
The RegistryKey parameter specifies the registry key created under HKCU (“Registry User{NON_PRIVILEGED_USER_SID}”, while the DriverImagePath specifies the location of the driver in the file system.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It is possible to verify the driver was loaded successfully using the DriverView tool.<br/>
