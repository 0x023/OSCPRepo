Basic Usage<br/>
Tokenvator can be run in an interactive prompt, or commands can be provided as command line arguments. In the interactive mode, base commands will tab complete, with double tabs providing context specific help.<br/>

Steal_Token<br/>
At it’s most basic level, Tokenvator is used to access and manipulate Windows authentication tokens. To appropriate the token of another process, we can run the Steal_Token command with the target process’s PID.<br/>
<br/>
GetSystem<br/>
The most common token I need to steal is for the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account. The GetSystem command was created as a wrapper for Steal_Token to automatically find and access SYSTEM tokens. It works with the same syntax as Steal_Token. Note: This needs to be run from an elevated context.<br/>
<br/>
GetTrustedInstaller<br/>
It is common for the files in the SYSTEM32 folder or parts of the registry to be owned by the TRUSTEDINSTALLER group. To manipulate the contents of these locations, we can either take ownership or get an access token that has membership in the TRUSTEDINSTALLER group. Similar to GetSystem, GetTrustedInstaller is a wrapper for Steal_Token that starts the TrustedInstaller service and appropriates it’s token.<br/>
<br/>
List_Privileges and Set_Privilege<br/>
Sometimes our process doesn’t have the particular access right that we need in order to complete a task. For instance, to access a process that your current user doesn’t own, the SeDebugPrivilege is required. Shown below is a split token in a high integrity process (UAC Elevated – TokenElevationTypeFull)<br/>
<br/>
BypassUAC<br/>
UAC bypasses have become plentiful that this point, however one of the more interesting ones comes from manipulating tokens. FuzzySecurity has done some very interesting work on a UAC bypass method utilizing Windows tokens. Tokenvator includes an implementation of the technique he published. Below, our unprivileged token can be used to access an elevated process our current user owns and spawn an elevated shell.<br/>

Finding User Processes<br/>
For finding a user on a system there are multiple methods for identification. </body></html>
