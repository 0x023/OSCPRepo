Slide Notes<br/>
<br/>
-This is the most flexible class of settings, and it’s where admins can set up any custom registry entries they see fit.<br/>
-You'll find a bunch of fun stuff in here.<br/>
-The most useful examples are things like VNC passwords, which are encrypted using a standard method and key, so you can easily decrypt those and have a nice time.<br/>
-Another favourite is, Autologon credentials. These aren’t stored encrypted, just right there in the registry in plain text. These will often be pretty rubbish stuff like low-privilege accounts for kiosk machines but sometimes you’ll get something great like “the account used for the big TV in the network admins’ area that shows all of their monitoring stuff and therefore had to have access to all the monitoring stuff and it was easiest to just make it a domain admin.”<br/>
-This category tends to be very noisy, especially in shops with very old-school admins.</body></html>
