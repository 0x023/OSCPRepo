</head><body>How do I know which policies apply to which users and computers?<br/>
TL;DR use PowerView<br/>
<br/>
To see the policies:<br/>
Get-DomainGPO<br/>
<br/>
To see the policies that apply to a given user/computer:<br/>
Get-DomainGPO -ComputerName testserver<br/>
Get-DomainGPO -UserName lowpriv<br/>
<br/>
To see the computers that a policy applies to:<br/>
Get-DomainOU | WhereObject {$_.gplink.contains(“{PUT THE GPO UID<br/>
HERE}”)} | %{Get-DomainComputer -ADSPath $_.distinguishedname}<br/>
<br/>
To figure out which settings from which policies actually apply and which get overwritten...<br/>
1. Local GPOs are applied first.<br/>
2. Then GPOs linked to a site.<br/>
3. Then GPOs linked to the domain.<br/>
4. Then GPOs linked to OUs, from the top down.<br/>
5. If multiple GPOs are linked at the same level, they apply from the bottom-up.<br/>
6. Last writer of a given setting wins.<br/>
<br/>

Slide Notes<br/>
- OK so you've found a policy which is gonna make computers super vulnerable but you can't tell which machines it's going to apply to. How do you figure it out?<ul><li style="list-style-type: none">The simple version is: Get PowerView, get the GPO's UID using Get-DomainGPO, and do like this:</li>
</ul>
- That'll tell you which OU(s) the policy is linked to. It's pretty rare in my experience to see people linking a GPO to multiple OUs but it can be done.<br/>
- If you pipe the results from that into some more PowerView goodness, like this:<br/>
- You should get a list of all computers to which a given policy applies. Same trick but with Get-DomainUser and you'll get the users it applies to. EZ.<br/>
- Well, it would be, but then there's the whole issue of policies overwriting one another, etc etc. I don't have an easy way to address that issue for you, but I can give you some useful info to help figure it out yourself:<br/>
- WMI filtering and read permissions on the policy itself can also affect whether a policy applies to a given user/computer. WMI filtering usually boils down to targeting policy based on OS version, but it can target a bunch of other attributes of a host too.</body></html>
