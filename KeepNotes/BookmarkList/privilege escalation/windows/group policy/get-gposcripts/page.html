If you can edit them, you own the user/computer they apply to.<br/>
Sometimes they have hard-coded creds in them. Delightful!<br/>

Slide Notes<br/>
<br/>
-This is where you can find startup/shutdown/logon/logoff scripts.<br/>
-If you're really lucky you'll find fun creds hard-coded in them.<br/>
-Most of them will be stored in SYSVOL and their file permissions won’t let you change them, but some will be on a random file server where an admin granted "Full Control" to the "Everyone" group because they were hung over or something. Once again, Grouper in -Online mode will tell you if you can modify the script in question.<br/>
<br/>
- Once again, you’ll also sometimes find creds being passed as arguments in these entries, in the name of ‘security’.</body></html>
