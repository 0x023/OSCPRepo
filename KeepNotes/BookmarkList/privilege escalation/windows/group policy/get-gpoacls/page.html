Admins hand out excessive privilege.<br/>
If you can edit a GPO, you own every user and computer it applies to.<br/>

Slide Notes<br/>
<br/>
-So, like many other things in Windowsland, GPOs are “securable objects”, meaning that they have ACLs.<br/>
-Like all things in all operating systems, Admins will happily hand out excessive permissions if it will make people leave them alone.<br/>
<b>-If you get write permissions on a GPO, you can basically own every user or computer that it applies to.</b>&nbsp;The New-GPOImmediateTask cmdlet from PowerView is the easiest way - it just creates a scheduled task that runs and then deletes itself.<br/>
-By the way, I saw RastaMouse mention on twitter the other day that he’s working on a PowerShell module to abuse a bunch of this stuff “in ways other than New-GPOImmediateTask”. I haven’t seen any more detail since then but should be fun.</body></html>
