Slide Notes<br/>
<br/>
-This one... does what it says on the tin. Loads a Windows MSI installer file from somewhere on the network and installs it on the host.<br/>
-Again, Grouper in -online mode will tell you who can modify the source file. If that who is you, then... ding!<br/>
-This is the one I see most often in the wild so definitely check it out.</body></html>
