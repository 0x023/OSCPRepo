Slide Notes<br/>
<br/>
-This is where you can see users getting added to or removed from local groups, most often the local administrators and remote desktop users groups.<br/>
-Don't forget though, that there are good times to be had from groups like 'backup operators' which is Microsoft-speak for 'read-write access to the whole FS as long as you use the backup API to do it’.<br/>
-This policy setting goes a long way to helping find those machines that your account has RDP access to, but which tools like BloodHound won’t point out because you don’t have full admin access.</body></html>
