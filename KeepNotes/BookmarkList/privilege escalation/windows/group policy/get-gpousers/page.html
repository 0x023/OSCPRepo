Slide Notes<br/>
<br/>
-This is where our old friends Group Policy Preferences passwords live. These were such a problem that Microsoft pushed out a patch to stop admins creating new ones.<br/>
-Basically if an admin used this feature to set local creds on a host, you can just read them. They’re encrypted, but using a single universal key that is published on TechNet.<br/>
-Grouper will decrypt these creds for you, although for completeness it might be worth using PowerSploit’s “Get-GPPPassword” too, because there’s an edge-case I ran into a couple weeks back, where a replication error a long time ago can create old broken policy folders that stick around but can’t be seen in the GPOReport that Grouper reads.<br/>
-This section can also include a bunch of handy information like 'they changed the "administrator" account to be named "sysadmin" ' or 'they created a local service account on this machine with a note saying 'username = password' in the description field.’</body></html>
