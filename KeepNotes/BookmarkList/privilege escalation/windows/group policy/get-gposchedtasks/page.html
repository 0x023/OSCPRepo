Slide Notes<br/>
<br/>
- Sets up scheduled tasks on the host. There’s a bunch of different fun ways to screw these up.<br/>
- they often run a binary or a script from a file share (and yes grouper will check if you can modify it)<br/>
- will often be configured to run as a service account and then the creds are stored in the policy object using the same encryption method used when adding local users.<br/>
- Admins who think that only they can read GPOs will think they’re being secure by not hard-coding creds in a script, but then they pass the creds as arguments defined in the GPO.</body></html>
