Slide Notes<br/>
<br/>
-This is for modifying, replacing, moving, adding files to a windows system. Commonly used for things like updating local config files with cleartext credentials in them, and it will often be used to "Install" simple in-house developed executables or scripts (from a network drive with weak file permissions no doubt) to paths on the local filesystem.<br/>
-In -online mode, Grouper will return the file permissions for the source file and will also check if the current user can modify it.<br/>
-Depending on the type of file being placed, you might need to get creative to do anything with this, but if it’s just a script or an exe, and it actually gets run, sub it out for something fun, have a real nice time.</body></html>
