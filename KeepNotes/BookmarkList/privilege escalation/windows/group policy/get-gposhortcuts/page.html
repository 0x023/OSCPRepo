-Get-GPOShortcuts Deploys .lnk files. These are useful for two reasons, the first being that admins love to set up the helpdesk with web bookmarks for all those awful internal web apps that<br/>
do insanely powerful things like reset user passwords or provision MFA tokens, so you can find those and make a real mess.<br/>
