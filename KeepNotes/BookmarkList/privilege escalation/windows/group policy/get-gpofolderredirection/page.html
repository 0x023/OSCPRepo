Exploitation difficulty varies from ‘trivial’ to ‘time to get creative’.<br/>

Slide Notes<br/>
<br/>
This nifty feature lets admins reconfigure users' home directories so that their Desktop or Documents folders are stored on a network file share with badly configured<br/>
permissions. There’s plenty of ways to get cute and creative with this one.<br/>
<br/>
- Replace a desktop shortcut with one that points at a malicious exe,<br/>
- or drop a shortcut file with the icon set to point at a machine running responder,<br/>
- or just steal passwords.txt from their desktop,<br/>
- or jam a nasty macro in one of their office docs.<br/>
- So many opportunities to get creative.</body></html>
