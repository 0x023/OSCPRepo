<title>Technique 2 NamedPipe DLL</title>
</head><body>/*<br/>
&nbsp;* Elevate from local admin to local system via Named Pipe Impersonation. We spawn a service under local <br/>
&nbsp;* system which then connects to our named pipe and we impersonate this client. This can be done by an <br/>
&nbsp;* Administrator without the need for SeDebugPrivilege, however a dll (elevator.dll) must be written to <br/>
&nbsp;* disk. Works on NT4, 2000, XP, 2003 and 2008 for all local administrators. On Vista and 7 it <b>will only <br/>
</b><b>&nbsp;* work if the host process has been elevated through UAC first.</b><br/>

<br/>
Similar to technique 1; however need to drop elevator.dll to disk<br/>
<br/>
Uses rundll32.exe a /p<br/>
Writes file<br/>
