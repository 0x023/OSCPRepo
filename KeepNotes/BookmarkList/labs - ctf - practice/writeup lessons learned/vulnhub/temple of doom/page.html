</head><body>if you ever see an application error...no matter how minor...it's worth poking at for more severe implications<br/>
ie: json says error at X location, maybe serialization. maybe passing to something else to execute. maybe something more<br/>
<br/>
python shells are awesome<br/>
Always have a way to spawn a second shell <br/>
<br/>
look at network connections, including UDP<br/>
look at processes other people are running. Priv esc isn't always straight to root...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
sudo tcpdump requires -Z root and -z ./file is way easier to exploit than trying single commands like on gtfo bins</body></html>
