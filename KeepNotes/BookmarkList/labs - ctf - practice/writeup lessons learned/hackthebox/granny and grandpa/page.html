<title>Granny and Grandpa</title>
</head><body>Granny first:<br/>
Force a challenge: must hack grandpa (14) through granny (15)<br/>
iptables -A OUTPUT -d 10.10.10.14 -j DROP &#09;&#09;#block our direct access to grandpa <br/>
<br/>
davtest:<br/>
basic webdav type enumeration. PUTS and EXECs. <br/>
<br/>
If you can upload certain files (.html) and not others (.aspx) but have the option for the MOVE http command, you can do so to rename your file. <br/>
<br/>
MOVE /shell.txt<br/>
Destination: /shell.aspx<br/>
<br/>
Meterpreter set macro/script to migrate as soon as you have a session<br/>
<br/>
Hashcat cracking LM, brute both sides of the hash. start with 7 and decrement until you have both sides<br/>
?u?u?u?u?u?u?u<br/>
?u?u?u?u?u?u<br/>
?u?u?u?u?u<br/>
etc<br/>
<br/>
?u is hashcat for bruteforcing a capital letter (which LM is all caps)<br/>
<br/>
Take cracked LM hash in both upper and lower, put them in a dictionary, now crack the NTLM:<br/>
hashcat -m 1000 ntlm.hash lm.dict -r rules/toggles5.rule <br/>
<br/>
the rule will toggle casing. since LM is all upper, it is usually NOT the actual password, but NTLM will have actual password with casing <br/>
<br/>
CTRL + R: start typing command and it will autofill. Basically universal. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes if you get an error executing a meterpreter command (even though you have a session) try migrating to a different process<br/>
