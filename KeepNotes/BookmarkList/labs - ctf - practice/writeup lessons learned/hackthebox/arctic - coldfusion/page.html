Look around for an administrator login page<br/>

MSF: show advanced<br/>
Set verbosity and other (potentially) useful variables<br/>
<br/>
BURP: need to help debug requests other tools are making and they don't have proxy support? <br/>
Proxy &gt; Options &gt; add new listener<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Bind port and under request handling, redirect to host:port<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;ie: bind localhost and auto redirect to the web server<br/>
Now run your tools against "localhost:burp_port" and it will go through BURP and auto redirect to the web server<br/>

Upgrade your simple Windows CMD reverse shell to something more powerful:<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;python unicorn trustedsec<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Windows to Meterpreter for example<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Unicorn supports PowerShell commands, so be aware this may not work for older versions of windows<br/>

<br/>
Migrate into an x64 process to automatically change to x64 and vice-versa</body></html>
