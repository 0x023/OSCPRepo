<title>Example Attacks</title>
</head><body>Google Products:<br/>
The apps used to control Google Home products make use of an undocumented REST API running on port 8008 of these devices (e.g. http://192.168.1.208:8008). This API provides extensive device control without any form of authentication. Some of the most interesting features include the ability to launch entertainment apps and play content, scan and join nearby WiFi networks, reboot, and even factory reset the device. <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/U3tUqmRf">Here is an example</a> of some of the data that I’ve exfiltrated from my own Chromecast. <a href="https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/vert/googles-newest-feature-find-my-home/#.WyfDEMLoy-g.twitter">Craig Young's simultaneous and independent research</a>&nbsp;on this vulnerability was disclosed yesterday, just ahead of this post. He actually created a PoC for the geolocation attack scenario that I described above, but never implemented! His work, and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/06/google-to-fix-location-data-leak-in-google-home-chromecast/">Brian Kreb's commentary on it</a>&nbsp;are both excellent. &nbsp;<br/>

Sonos WiFi speakers:<br/>
After a bit of digging I found a few other interesting links to be followed on the Sonos UPnP web server that might not be so innocent. It appears that several hidden web pages are accessible on the device for debugging purposes. http://192.168.1.76:1400/support/review serves an XML file that appears to contain the output of several Unix commands run on the Sonos device (which itself seems to run a distribution of Linux). http://192.168.1.76:1400/tools provides a bare bones HTML form that lets you run a few of these Unix commands on the Sonos device yourself! The Sonos HTTP API allows a remote attacker to map internal and external networks using the traceroute command and probe hosts with ICMP requests with ping using simple POST requests. An attacker could use a Sonos device as a pivot point to gather useful network topology and connectivity information to be used in a follow up attack.<br/>

Roku:<br/>
While exploring the network in the lounge at my work building, I found an HTTP server running on port 8060 of a RokuTV. I soon found that Roku’s External Control API provides control over basic functionality of the device, like launching apps, searching, and playing content. Interestingly, it also allows direct control over button and key presses like a virtual remote, as well as input for several sensors including an accelerometer, orientation sensor, gyroscope and even a magnetometer (why?) As you’ve probably guessed, this local API requires no authentication and can be exploited via DNS rebinding (CVE-2018–11314).<br/>
<br/>
Routers:<br/>
Own the router and you own the network. There are two common attack vectors that I’ve seen with DNS rebinding:<br/>
POSTing default credentials to a login page like http://192.168.1.1/loginto own router admin. Once the attacker has authenticated they have full device control and can configure the network as they please.<br/>
Using a router’s Internet Gateway Device (IGD) interface through UPnP to configure permanent port forwarding connections and expose arbitrary UDP &amp; TCP ports on the network to the public Internet.<br/>
