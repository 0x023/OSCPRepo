<div style="text-align: justify">SQL injection is bad and something people need to avoid by developing web applications safely. There are some tips for this:<br/>
</div>&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;Sanitize input data: Input entered from the user should not contain any sql sentences or commands at all. Check for good data by validating for type, length, format, and range.</li>
<li>Use store procedures: Your web application should have predetermined SQL sentences for data access. If the user request some specific information, the application invokes the specific store procedure, so there is no possibility of crafting dynamic SQL request.</li>
<li>Use an account with restricted permissions in the database. You should only grant execute permissions to selected stored procedures in the database and provide no direct table access.</li>
<li>Avoid disclosing database error information. Make sure you do not disclose detailed error messages to the user, because detailed error information shows the attacker where to check if the attack was unsuccessful.</li>
</ul>
