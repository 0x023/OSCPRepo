</head><body>Testing for NoSQL injection vulnerabilities in MongoDB: <br/>
The MongoDB API expects BSON (Binary JSON) calls, and includes a secure BSON query assembly tool. However, according to MongoDB documentation - unserialized JSON and JavaScript expressions are permitted in several alternative query parameters.[4] The most commonly used API call allowing arbitrary JavaScript input is the $where operator.<br/>
<br/>
The MongoDB $where operator typically is used as a simple filter or check, as it is within SQL.<br/>
db.myCollection.find( { $where: "this.credits == this.debits" } );<br/>
<br/>
Optionally JavaScript is also evaluated to allow more advanced conditions.<br/>
db.myCollection.find( { $where: function() { return obj.credits - obj.debits &lt; 0; } } );<br/>
