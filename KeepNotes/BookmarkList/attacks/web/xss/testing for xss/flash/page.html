<title>Flash</title>
</head><body>Flash! is a popular application for displaying animated visual information. It has it’s own development language (ActiveScript) for creating sophisticated interactive menus, animated movies and games. ActiveScript has an internal function called getURL(). This function is used for redirecting the client browser to another page. Normally the parameter supplied to the function would be a URL. However, due to integration features between the Flash! interpreter and the web browser, it is possible to insert scripting code that would be successfully interpreted by the client web browser.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, instead of: <br/>
getURL("http://www.technicalinfo.net")<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to specify scripting code: <br/>
getURL("javascript:alert(document.cookie)")<br/>
<br/>
Thus, it is possible to embed potentially dangerous scripting elements within a common file format. The real significance of this threat is that it potentially bypasses many corporate content inspection systems (particularly those that filter out HTML &lt;script&gt; type tags) and local security web browser settings. <br/>
<br/>
For an attack to be successful, the dangerous Flash! file (typically terminating in a “.swf” extension) must be embedded within HTML data for viewing by remote clients. Normally this occurs with the use of the &lt;EMBED&gt; or &lt;OBJECT&gt; tags, for instance:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;EMBED <br/>
src="http://evil.org/badflash.swf" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi? <br/>
P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash" <br/>
type="application/x-shockwave-flash" <br/>
width="100" <br/>
height="100"&gt; <br/>
&lt;/EMBED&gt;</body></html>
