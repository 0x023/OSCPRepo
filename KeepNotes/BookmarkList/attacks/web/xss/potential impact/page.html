<title>Potential Impact</title>
</head><body>Complete control over the browser The attacker can access plugins. Like password managers. The attacker can trick the user into allowing webcam or audio.<br/>
<br/>
Session-hijacking/Cookie theft This is when the attacker steals the cookie that is saved in the browser. Using this cookie the attacker can log in to the service as the victim, and thereby gain access to his/her account. If the victim is an admin that has extended privileges (uploading code, images, or whatever) this could lead to a compromise of the server itself.<br/>
<br/>
Keylogger The attacker can execute a keylogging-script that steals everything the user inputs in the website. This could be used to steal sensitive information, like passwords, credit cards information, chatlogs or whatever the user inputs.<br/>
<br/>
Phishing The attacker can insert a fake login. Image that you visit a site, and from that site you are able to login using your facebook or google-account. The attacker could spoof that so that when you enter your credentials, they are then sent to the attacker.<br/>
<br/>
Browser exploits The script can redirect to a another page that issues an attack against the browser, possibly leading to total takeover of the machine.</body></html>
