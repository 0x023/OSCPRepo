</head><body>Preventing fileshare access through Exchange<br/>
The ability to download files was reported to Microsoft with MWR's belief that this was legacy code from when OWA supported the functionality. Microsoft informed MWR that the ability to do this is by design and directed MWR to guidance on overriding the default exchange setting that allows downloading of files. <br/>
<br/>
Organisations are recommended to disable fileshare access and sharepoint access through Exchange ActiveSync. Guidance can be found <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb123756(v=exchg.160).aspx">here</a>&nbsp;at and requires setting the following parameters to false:<br/>
<br/>
UNCAccessEnabled<br/>
WSSAccessEnabled<br/>
&nbsp;MWR also strongly recommend that organisations use client certificates on endpoints such as OWA and EAS.<br/>
<br/>

Logging<br/>
Detection of fileshare access<br/>
Investigation was done as to the forensic artifacts done when an attacker exploits this functionality.<br/>
<br/>
A new user mailbox was created with the name filesharetest for use in identifying means of detection.<br/>
<br/>
To list file shares the following PEAS command was used:<br/>
<br/>
python -m peas -u filesharetest -p ChangeMe123 --list-unc='\\fictitious-dc' 10.207.7.100<br/>
<br/>
and to download a file from a file share:<br/>
<br/>
python -m peas -u filesharetest -p ChangeMe123 --dl-unc='\\fictitious-dc\hr\passwords.txt' 10.207.7.100<br/>
<br/>
Exchange admin center (EAC)<br/>
The EAC showed the devices for each user that had accessed Exchange using EAS. These could be viewed under recipients &gt; mailboxes &gt; *specific mailbox* &gt; View details.<br/>
<br/>
The PEAS tool resulted in an entry with the family and model listed as "Python". This indicated that if the details are not forged to that of a valid mobile device, the entry may stand out.<br/>
<br/>
Exchange management shell<br/>
Manual review through the web interface is likely to be time consuming in real investigations. The Exchange cmdlet Get-ActiveSyncDevice was used to list all known devices, which could then be parsed, processed and reviewed to identify anomalies.<br/>
<br/>
Exchange logs<br/>
As of Exchange 2013, logging was enabled for many Exchange components by default (ref).<br/>
<br/>
Logs were located in &lt;Install Drive&gt;\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\Logging.<br/>
<br/>
The log file format was:<br/>
<br/>
DateTime,RequestId,MajorVersion,MinorVersion,BuildVersion,RevisionVersion,ClientRequestId,Protocol,UrlStem,ProtocolAction,AuthenticationType,IsAuthenticated,AuthenticatedUser,Organization,AnchorMailbox,UserAgent,ClientIpAddress,ServerHostName,HttpStatus,BackEndStatus,ErrorCode,Method,ProxyAction,TargetServer,TargetServerVersion,RoutingHint,BackEndCookie,ServerLocatorHost,ServerLocatorLatency,RequestBytes,ResponseBytes,TargetOutstandingRequests,AuthModulePerfContext,HttpPipelineLatency,CalculateTargetBackEndLatency,GlsLatencyBreakup,TotalGlsLatency,AccountForestLatencyBreakup,TotalAccountForestLatency,ResourceForestLatencyBreakup,TotalResourceForestLatency,ADLatency,ActivityContextLifeTime,ModuleToHandlerSwitching,FirstResponseByteReceived,ProxyTime,RequestHandlerLatency,HandlerToModuleSwitching,HttpProxyOverhead,TotalRequestTime,UrlQuery,GenericInfo,GenericErrors<br/>

The items of immediate interest in the request were the UserAgent of 'Python', the DeviceId and DeviceType, however these could easily be forged to have realistic values and would need to be checked against a list of known good devices, which even then would not be a guarantee. The Cmd=Search string indicated that a search had been performed but it does not distinguish between a file share search and other types of search.<br/>

The Cmd=ItemOperations string in this request indicated that something was being fetched from the server but it does not confirm a file from a file share was requested.<br/>

Windows event log<br/>
With detailed file share logging enabled, event logs were created with event ID 5145 that showed the target path of files accessed. It was not determined whether these were distinguishable from normal share access alone but they could be correlated with the time stamps from the IIS or Exchange logs. When testing, the time stamps between the logs were identical after taking into account timezone offsets.<br/>

Suggested investigatory steps<br/>
Parse the output of Exchange cmdlet Get-ActiveSyncDevice and review for anomalies.<br/>
Parse IIS and Exchange logs for EAS command entries, in particular those containing Cmd=ItemOperations.<br/>
Consider what level of investigation is possible given the number of results.<br/>
Consider if known legitimate devices and EAS requests can be removed.<br/>
Correlate entries with Windows event logs to determine if a file share was accessed at the same time as an EAS command and what was accessed.</body></html>
