<title>Useful EAS Tools</title>
</head><body>Only two Python projects could talk directly to a server using EAS: pyActiveSync and py-eas-client. A comparison was made of their functionality to assess which was a more complete implementation of the protocol and which would be more useful for the research. A wrapper for both libraries was written in the process to create a consistent interface and to form the basis of the tool to be produced as output of the research.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/solbirn/pyActiveSync">pyActiveSync</a><br/>
pyActiveSync partially supported at least EAS 12.1, implementing seventeen of the twenty-three commands offered by the server. It came with some sample code but lacked documentation.<br/>
<br/>
pyActiveSync required the creation of a Python source file called proto_creds.py, containing the EAS server address, a username and password. It persistently stored values in a local database to allow it to resume some operations using previous values.<br/>
<br/>
To make use of the library with the test environment, SSL verification had to be disabled. The example code tried to request "suggested contacts", which didn't exist so also had to be disabled. After this the library was able to request email from the test server successfully.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/ghiewa/py-eas-client">py-eas-client</a><br/>
py-eas-client came as a package with a proper setup.py script and installed successfully. It only supported four of the twenty-three commands offered by the server however. It came with a sample script but lacked documentation.<br/>
<br/>
py-eas-client used Twisted which meant its functionality was tied to the Twisted library's way of doing things asynchronously, which could've caused difficulties extending it. It also produced WBXML from Python dictionaries, making it restrictive, which caused an issue for another user, leading them to use libwbxml instead.<br/>
<br/>
To make use of the library with the test environment, again SSL verification had to be disabled. This proved more difficult because an understanding of Twisted was required. The example code tried to request a message with a hard-coded index that didn't exist, so this was modified to request all returned message indexes. After this the library was able to request email from the test server successfully.<br/>
<br/>
Software Review Conclusion<br/>
pyActiveSync supported significantly more commands than py-eas-client, was updated more recently and didn't require a transition to the Twisted paradigm. This made pyActiveSync the preferable choice for use in the research.</body></html>
