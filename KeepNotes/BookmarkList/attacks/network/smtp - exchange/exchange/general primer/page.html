Exchange has a broad ‘attack surface’ owing to the number of external interfaces. Email is a prime one and a number of vulnerabilities have been reported in internal email parsers that would give code execution in Exchange itself. A notably amusing example can be found <a href="http://blog.talosintel.com/2016/07/vulnerability-spotlight-oracles-outside.html">here</a>. It has also recently been <a href="https://silentbreaksecurity.com/malicious-outlook-rules/">found</a>&nbsp;that the ability to set complex message handling rules can be abused to gain code execution on workstations.<br/>
