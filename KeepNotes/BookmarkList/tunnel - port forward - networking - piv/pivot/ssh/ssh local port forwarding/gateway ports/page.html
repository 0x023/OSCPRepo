<title>Gateway Ports</title>
</head><body>GatewayPorts<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Specifies whether remote hosts are allowed to connect to local<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; forwarded ports. &nbsp;By default, ssh(1) binds local port forwardings<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the loopback address. &nbsp;This prevents other remote hosts from<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; connecting to forwarded ports. &nbsp;GatewayPorts can be used to spec‐<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ify that ssh should bind local port forwardings to the wildcard<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; address, thus allowing remote hosts to connect to forwarded<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ports. &nbsp;The argument must be “yes” or “no”. &nbsp;The default is “no”.<br/>
<br/>
And you can use localhost instead of M in the forwarding, as you're forwarding to the same machine as you're SSH-ing to -- if I understand your question correctly.<br/>
<br/>
So, the command will become this:<br/>
<br/>
ssh -L 2222:localhost:8888 -N -o GatewayPorts=yes hostname-of-M<br/>
<br/>
and will look like this in netstat -nltp:<br/>
<br/>
tcp &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0 &nbsp; &nbsp;0.0.0.0:2222 &nbsp; 0.0.0.0:* &nbsp;LISTEN &nbsp;5113/ssh<br/>
<br/>
Now anyone accessing this machine at port 2222 TCP will actually talk to localhost:8888 as seen in machine M. Note that this is not the same as plain forwarding to port 8888 of M.</body></html>
