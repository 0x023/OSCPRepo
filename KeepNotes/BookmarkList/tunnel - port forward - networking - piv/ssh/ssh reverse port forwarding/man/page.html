&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Specifies that the given port on the remote (server) host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the local side. &nbsp;This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;remote side, and whenever a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is made to host port hostport from the local<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;machine.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file. &nbsp;Privileged ports can be forwarded only when logging in as root on the remote machine. &nbsp;IPv6 addresses can be speci‐<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fied by enclosing the address in square braces.<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By default, the listening socket on the server will be bound to the loopback interface only. &nbsp;This may be overridden by specifying a bind_address. &nbsp;An empty bind_address, or the<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;address ‘*’, indicates that the remote socket should listen on all interfaces. &nbsp;Specifying a remote bind_address will only succeed if the server's GatewayPorts option is enabled (see<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sshd_config(5)).<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If the port argument is ‘0’, the listen port will be dynamically allocated on the server and reported to the client at run time. &nbsp;When used together with -O forward the allocated port<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;will be printed to the standard output.<br/>
