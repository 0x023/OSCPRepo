&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Specifies that the given port on the local (client) host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the remote side. &nbsp;This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;local side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address. &nbsp;Whenever a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is made<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to host port hostport from the remote machine. &nbsp;Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file. &nbsp;IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;brackets. &nbsp;Only the superuser can forward privileged ports. &nbsp;By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the GatewayPorts setting. &nbsp;However, an explicit bind_address may be<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;used to bind the connection to a specific address. &nbsp;The bind_address of “localhost” indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indi‐<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;cates that the port should be available from all interfaces.<br/>
