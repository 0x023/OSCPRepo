</head><body>Credentials in the clear - If you are concerned about who might be listening in on your network activity then PsExec is probably not the best tool to use. PsExec transmits all user credentials supplied to it in the clear, meaning that if you supply a username and password to access a system remotely, anybody with a copy of Wireshark or Tcpdump running can intercept the credentials.<br/>
<br/>
Antivirus Detection - This used to not be as much of an issue, but now that most virus scanning applications do some level of system and memory monitoring most of them will catch PsExec being used on the system they are monitoring. If you are doing a penetration test on a Windows system and PsExec isn't working as it should be then chances are you are getting blocked by antivirus, and worse yet, you may be letting the end user know you are toying with their system.<br/>
<br/>
PsExec and Metasploit - When possible I never use PsExec by itself anymore. A modified version of PsExec is now included in the Metasploit Framework. Metasploit is a penetration testing framework that provides quite a bit of functionality. If you want to use PsExec for some form of security assessment then considering looking into the added functionality Metasploit provides with it.</body></html>
