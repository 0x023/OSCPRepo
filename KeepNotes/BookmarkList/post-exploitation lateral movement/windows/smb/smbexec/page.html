On git while it lasts: https://github.com/brav0hax/smbexec<br/>
Impacket Python implementation: https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbexec.py<br/>

The quick description is that smbexec is a tool that focuses on using native windows functions/features for post exploitation and expanding access on a network after you gain some credentials, whether that be a hash or password for a local or domain account. It allows a pentester to quickly identify targets of interest and gain access to them across large networks without much need to worry about AV and UAC.<br/>
