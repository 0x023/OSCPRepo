</head><body>If the DLL is on the list of known DLLs for the version of Windows on which the application is running, <b>the system uses its copy</b>&nbsp;of the known DLL (and the known DLL's dependent DLLs, if any) <b>instead of searching</b>&nbsp;for the DLL. For a list of known DLLs on the current system, see the following registry key:Â <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\KnownDLLs</b>.</body></html>
