"ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin"=dword:00000005<br/>
"ConsentPromptBehaviorUser"=dword:00000003<br/>
"EnableInstallerDetection"=dword:00000001<br/>
"EnableLUA"=dword:00000001<br/>
"EnableSecureUIAPaths"=dword:00000001<br/>
"EnableUIADesktopToggle"=dword:00000000<br/>
"EnableVirtualization"=dword:00000001<br/>
"FilterAdministratorToken"=dword:00000000<br/>
"PromptOnSecureDesktop"=dword:00000001<br/>
"ValidateAdminCodeSignatures"=dword:00000000<br/>
<br/>
When the slider is moved upto “Always notify me” it changes this value<br/>
<br/>
"ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin"=dword:00000002<br/>
<br/>
When the slider is moved down to “Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer (do not dim desktop settings)” it changes this value<br/>
<br/>
"PromptOnSecureDesktop"=dword:00000000<br/>
<br/>
And when the slider is moved to “Never notify” the values changed are<br/>
<br/>
"ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin"=dword:00000000<br/>
"EnableLUA"=dword:00000000<br/>
"PromptOnSecureDesktop"=dword:00000000<br/>
<br/>
Take note that EnableLUA has been disabled completely. This is an extremely dangerous value to be in and should never be disabled so its strongly recommend to set this settings to be enabled in group policies so it always gets applied if settings are reset/changed by users or by previously removed malware.<br/>
<br/>
Once disabled not only a malicious process could be able to go straight to high integrity without any bypass but also Internet Explorer would run in medium integrity. UAC gives us the Protected Mode (sandbox) in Internet Explorer providing added security. Internet Explorer normally runs in low integrity child process so if compromised by some IE exploit the damage is minimized as in low integrity there are only a handful of locations it can be written to on the system.<br/>
<br/>
These changes mentioned above have been seen on Windows 7. On Windows 8/8.1 EnableLUA does not change to disabled. So when the slider is moved to "Never" notify the values changed are only<br/>
<br/>
"ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin"=dword:00000000<br/>
"PromptOnSecureDesktop"=dword:00000000<br/>
Since value “EnableLUA”=dword:00000001 does not change, UAC is not completely disabled and Internet Explorer would still run in low integrity.<br/>
<br/>
If however a user logged onto a machine using the local admin account (administrator or whatever renamed on your corporate build) UAC settings does not apply as all processes run in high integrity</body></html>
