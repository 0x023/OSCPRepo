This is most likely due to a program that is incompatible with this version of Windows. Please contact the program's manufacturer to make sure you have a compatible program version.<br/>

4960&#09;IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed an integrity check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations.<br/>
4961&#09;IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer.<br/>
4962&#09;IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay.<br/>
4963&#09;IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. If the remote computer is configured with a Request Outbound IPsec policy, this might be benign and expected. This can also be caused by the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt.<br/>
4965&#09;IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored.<br/>
5478&#09;The IPsec Policy Agent service was started.<br/>

5480&#09;IPsec Policy Agent failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters.

5484&#09;The IPsec Policy Agent service experienced a critical failure and has shut down. The shutdown of this service can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks.<br/>
5485&#09;IPsec Policy Agent failed to process some IPsec filters on a plug-and-play event for network interfaces.
